<HS> is indeed a very stupid and useless defender. I hate the sight of him on the pitch. No way this guy is captain of my team. Drop him immediately. <CN> You got that right bro. Clearly the board demands he plays.
<HS> These are my furbabies, Pixel, Nala, Ziggy and Fonzie all rescues and if anyone hurt them and that includes you I’d fucking kill you. People who hurt animals are the scum of the earth 🤬 #StopAnimalCruelty #AdoptDontShop #fuckkurtzouma <CN> I’d delete this post , incase anyone see this an reports it , I know you mean well , but the part where you say you’ll kill him may be a tad over board lol
<HS> Shut up <CN> SLAY QUEEEEEEN #GirlBoss #talkthattalk
<HS> fuck you <CN> Strange, you forgot about grealish ? Yes, he played 100m
<HS> Absolutely disgusting behaviour. What a prick <CN> We need more custodial sentences for animal cruelty & lifetime bans on owning animals 😡
<HS> Ratio you snaking rat. <CN> Counter for repping him and being obsessed
<HS> Shut up <CN> Are you being disrespectful on behalf of
<HS> Weasel, as soon as my backs turned sneaks in the door!! <CN> He doesn't wear shorts as good as you though!
<HS> Shit and useless player <CN> Dang yall mad asd
<HS> hope you know you were an absolute disgrace from start to finish, me pissing about on the ball to going straight down the tunnel after the game, we pay our hard earned money home and away every week and the least you could do is clap us away, absolutely pathetic <CN> Why @ him. Alot worse on the field he created more chances than most
<HS> go away fred <CN> Shut up
<HS> Damn right here here 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 wanker <CN> Have you seen the video this morning of the player Jason Kerr picking up a frightened cat and carrying him off the pitch? Heartwarming and shows that not everyone is as evil as Zouma. #CatLivesMatter 🐈🙂
<HS> Your career is over. Rot in hell you spineless coward pig <CN> What did he do ???
<HS> Kurt Zouma faces up to four years in prison in France for kicking cat I really hope ⁦⁩ goes to jail. He’s a disgrace but an even bigger disgrace is ⁦ who condone his actions by continuing to pick him. Shameful. <CN> I suspect WHU FC are expecting this to quietly go away.
<HS> Ur shit pal how about catching some crosses? <CN> Bro, David is aight
<HS> 7 years of memories and not one trophy you clown😭 <CN> So thats all that matters is it
<HS> Gettout of my club useless player <CN> Too soon boss too soon
<HS> Nice 1 for everything u crazy little bustard u <CN> Everything? What did he do for yous 😕
<HS> ***TW: Animal Abuse*** this MASE POES () is straight up abusing this poor cat, damn. you are SICK sir. so is your brother that's laughing and recording and the child that is well on his way growing up to becoming as SICK as the 2 of you DOM NAAIERS <CN> WHY DO THAT TO THE POOR CAT!!!??? NOT OK!!! 😭
<HS> You are a disgrace. <CN> He claims to congratulate the winner yet he’s clearly slandering Messi and Lewandoski and says he comments on a posts that says he should’ve won it,😂😂😂 what a hypocrite
<HS> you're a bum <CN> Get a life, man. 🤦🤦
<HS> Pinche ojete, eres un puto for spitting on your teammate.. you dirty ass mf. Retire dawg <CN> What??? Who did he spit on?
<HS> He's out, get him out fuck off <CN> Respect him
<HS> Watching the Wolfsburg game and fuck you , this idiot kicked Guilavogui and got him sent off. Got Sevilla a controversial penalty. Last season he slapped Martial and got him sent off 🙄🤦 wtf is with this guy and cheating? <CN> totally agree, but how does that ref give the guy a red. im literally still shocked like my team (Man Utd) won but i feel football lost here. Lamela needs to be slapped really
<HS> F u c k off <CN> What happend now?
<HS> Winning by default is by All means nothing to be proud about, 12 men on the pitch and still took you 88 minutes to score should not have been on the pitch to score the winner + the non penalty, yeah well done #VAR 💩💩💩 <CN> Just the truth lad, we're not the ones on the brink of bankruptcy and points deduction
<HS> You’re a fraud Penaldo <CN> Awks
<HS> Yeah sorry he got caught, not sorry he did it.. sick bastard <CN> My thoughts too
<HS> Full of shit Bruno, how many times we going to hit the reset button this season, tactics are terrible and we need a CDM, I don’t want to see McFred ever play together again. The fans have spoken, we want Ole, Carrick, Phelan and McKenna out. <CN> By the way, you were far ahead of the rest today, you lead by example, pity the rest of the midfield did not follow you.
<HS> 🤣🤣🤣 I know it’s not funny but them pics are brilliant. Btw your scum <CN> He wants some boot the knobhead
<HS> My dislike for has been re-ignited 😠😠 <CN> 🤣🤣. All u na Man Utd fans. Leave him alone o
<HS> Wtf have i just heard get greenwood out of this club fuck off <CN> He should never play for us again
<HS> That frigging cheat was already on his way diving. <CN> As if Xhaka hasn't done this shit before, his first name should be penalty 🤣😂
<HS> This is the closest I've come to turning my bk on and start watching a local team like aldershot... Toothless gutless over paid cxxts. you can fxxk off ASAP. And yes I was about in the 90's. #ENICOut #levyout <CN> It's so hard to keep caring when the players clearly don't, literally dread the days spurs are playing now because it's always so shit, just gotta convince my mates I don't care so they stop bantering me haha
<HS> Fuck you I hate you <CN> what did he even do to you lmao?
<HS> Hi , you’re a piece of shit <CN> Can you say it louder for the people in the back? And louder still for the apes that are trying to defend him.
<HS> We don't want ya <CN> Its not up to you sadly
<HS> You're fake news <CN> I believe though bro. Check their body language after Ronaldo’s goal.
<HS> what a horrible person you are. You ahd no right to do that to your cat it was innocent. I hope you get the same done. Animal cruelty and who ever recorded it and laughed should be ashamed of them self. Disgusting behaviour <CN> West Ham and David Moyes are saying what Zouma did was stupid and terrible. They have fined him the maximum amount. He has not bribed anyone. He is deeply remorseful and regrets his action. Can we bloody move on now??. Or you just want to see Zouma drowning?.
<HS> Rewatching the City game and seeing the first goal, LENO does that all the time, ball coming in through where he stands and he goes down pretending to be trying to reach it. I want this fcuker arrested. Wallahi he's playing against us, he's done it over and over again <CN> I said this yesterday too. Leno et Chambers caused that shit. How can you pretend as if you will catch the ball and just go back.
<HS> Hold that you Ivorian bum <CN> You’re weird
<HS> Im absolutely fuming seeing this man… Beating on a helpless defenseless cat, sick vile person <CN> I take back everything I said about your Zouma slander
<HS> DISGUSTING: Footballer has been caught on film KICKING A CAT. What kind of person attacks a cat like this? , kick him off your team to send a message that animal cruelty is never acceptable. 😡 Pls RT so the world knows what he's done. <CN> Complete baxxxxd: poor cat can’t even get away. Shame on you: how would you like to be beaten!!!!!
<HS> leave my club..you 😠😡 <CN> Stfu clown
<HS> Where is come on 😡😤😤😤😤😤 <CN> Clown wanted to get him wet cz he hates him
<HS> 1 So my 11 year old son has quit his football team this week as a couple of team mates have told him he's he's terrible player! U get some reet horrible little twats! His confidence is down! He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> Probably jealous of his feet stick with it practice practice practice good luck enjoy it most importantly
<HS> Scum <CN> Your defenceless cat needs rehoming (as do you)

<HS> you bloody waste 30m on Vlasiç and say wasn't worth it You got to admit you are joking The idiot was nowhere to be seen Poor decision making in the final third <CN> Hes playing in a new system. Relax. You are acting like hes played a full season ffs
<HS> F*^k England off to good son <CN> Might aswel fuck Utd off aswel then😉
<HS> Please, with all disrespect, , FIND A NEW FUCKING CAREER AND LEAVE MY YOU FRAUD <CN> Hate makes greatness
<HS> Rip bozo <CN> Wat?
<HS> Spider 🕸️ <CN> That was a goal and he said, not on my watch!
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> Abeg Getat, GERROUT NOW we don't need a plastic fan anyway
<HS> If ever pulled a Jack Grealish on us I’ll never trust anyone ever again <CN> He'll be at Newcastle within 18 months
<HS> A man that understands 👏🏼 If you believe it was an isolated incident, you’re a moron. If you accept his apology, you’re a fool and if you think it’s not a big deal / acceptable then I sincerely hope you rot You’re a liar and deserve no forgiveness, just suffering <CN> Get a life. How do you know his apology is not genuine and what do you want him to do to show his remorse? Jump off a cliff?
<HS> [BODY] You racist ganza fake gangster 20 year old racist discriminatory squeaky voice no body hair 9 year old set 8 fortnite kid slyvester btech hannible lectre post your lone of 1,000,000 can't get that money cause your job fo bully saka is £0 looking <CN> [BODY] Mtschhheeewww.

<HS> What player would want to sit in the dressing room with a coward who films himself kicking and slapping a cat? This has fuck all to do with his profession or how much money he earns. This comes down to being a horrible vile human being!! Hope he rots!! 🤬🤬#KurtZouma <CN> Ease up mate he hasn't killed anyone players have carried on playing with players who have killed people and beat people up
<HS> Anyone supporting is predator - Please avoid him/her for your own good. <CN> terrible news, utterly devastated. Not just abuse, he raped her too. Shocking!
<HS> Have some dignity harry, please tell the coach to drop you. You are not fit to be a Manchester united Captain or player. Drop the band and get the f**k off the team. Shameless <CN> Tell the coach to drop you 😭😭😭 what kinda comment is that?
<HS> You are the biggest loser. You always are jealous of Messi and now you showed it. What a hypocrite ! Your family shouldn't be ashamed of yourself cause they are like you clown. <CN> He was not coming out like this because he thought he can catch the 6 but 7 is out of his reach and u know cry baby starts crying
<HS> Fat head <CN> Donkey
<HS> Didn’t touch you, ya soft twat 😂 <CN> Not condoning the throwing of anything, but this was like the magic bullet that shot JFK. Was it thrown from grassy knoll as it seems to take out Digne, Cash, and Douglas.
<HS> The classic ‘arse oot’ technique of <CN> I’m not, not saying that if permission were granted I’d get this as a tattoo
<HS> this awful human needs to be kicked off of Twitter. Also he should be charged. This is please kick him off Twitter for harming and hurting an animal and having it filmed and posted. <CN> Yes! 🙌🏻
<HS> You said something similar last week ffs, try getting Mason into a room and kicking his cunt in until he learns to pass the ball now and again. 🤷 <CN> Well Mason is a striker so he only scores when he shoots, so from working his way in to a shooting opportunity he takes the shot some go in some don’t, but he only gets better by learning his trade you following Stuart? Not to difficult for you great strikers are greedy, twat
<HS> pass the armband on you Easter island headed bastard <CN> Now now
<HS> “Im gonna fuck you you twat” you weird man. Get him behind bars <CN> Wait an judge announcement to attack, we only have listened one side of hustory
<HS> dei shut and go home la <CN> couldve gotten 80 million nasi lemaks, wouldve been better summore
<HS> entire United "squad" let their manager down today. He protected u dickheads but its obvious to see yall want him gone. Pussies <CN> Cowards
<HS> And this my fellow humans is a prime example of the utterly vile people that we are inflicted with in a daily basis. I would hope that someone kicks the living 💩 out of this excuse of a human being. you are a disgrace to humanity. <CN> Amen to that! Disgusting and to have the cheek to say that his cats are loved and cherished and shame on West Ham for starting him last night! 😡😡
<HS> They do not exist among humans 👎🏻 <CN> Christiano fan and a liverpool fan. Thats says it all really.
<HS> Munch says f*ck you <CN> Is munch the mad cat ? She would ave dealt wiv him
<HS> Words cannot describe how much hate I have for you <CN> if your racist just say so
<HS> Embarrassing <CN> He’s an England player so it won’t get called out. Nothing to see here
<HS> looks fucking shit mate. massive waste of your time and money. <CN> Maybe one google search would be enough to avoid that kind of comment ? We are working for 5 months on this project to have massive fundraising for Goodplanet Foundation. What are you doing to help the planet ? Plz read this : have a nice day
<HS> I’m just gonna say it, if this is the passion that’s gonna be shown while chasing a #UCL knockout game, might as well leave the club. Disgusting. #MUNATM <CN> I don’t think there was a lack of passion. He lacked the skill and execution. Running into defenders and not finding passes - was frustrating. I think we can say goodbye to the CR7 dream. 💔
<HS> Always knew leigh anne pinnock was a jealous low key bully!! Why doesn’t she call out her racist /bully d*ckhead of a boyfriend ! No wonder Jesy Nelson left the toxic group! #BullyingPreventionMonth #bully #bullying #LITTLEMIX #boyz #blackfishing <CN> I have to agree. I did not expect this behaviour from Leigh Anne. Pretty two faced. She can call out Jesy herself instead of asking others do it for her. What the hell. Surely those DMs are real.
<HS> Scumbag cheater loser <CN> MISSING:16/10/21 Last seen:KURTS BEDROOM Characteristics: Tap in merchant,Olivier Giroud regen, PE teacher,can’t score open goals on Dark Roll,gets scared of horror games,has an astounding record of2/44 predictions at the Euros.POSSIBLE LOCATIONS:His bedroom,playing with his doll

<HS> You need stoning you’re shite <CN> Do you watch football?
<HS> Snake🐍 <CN> Why bro... Wasn't the guy's fault. He went on to forfeit the money he could have earned.
<HS> Mikel Arteta is such a vindictive twat who should never have managed Arsenal Football Club. What a horrible human being. I stand with . <CN> You guys always find a way to blame arteta 😂😂🤣
<HS> Fuck me leave the club and take ole with you malteaser <CN> Jesus lad calm down fuck me
<HS> You’re a virus at my club, please leave <CN> More work rate than CFC you gotta chill mannn
<HS> Why own an animal just to abuse them? These are just the incidents that have been recorded as well. Scruffy ugly tramp <CN> Disgusting man
<HS> How disturbed do you have to be to cause such distress and pain to a defenseless animal ? Vile behaviour <CN> I understand worrying about the poor cat. It clearly shouldn't have been treated that way. But if violence against women, which happens more often, had the same coverage and caused as much public reaction, I could tell my niece that much happier times are ahead. #fuckviolence
<HS> This don thought he was on piss until he saw x LOL done a runner after that wasteman <CN> Obviously we know our Mick is a beast, but Kurt Zouma is someone you defo don’t step too either like you say 🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂 big imposing geezer & I’m so happy he’s gonna be at the heart of our back line ⚒️
<HS> Filth, absolute filth. That flick, . 🔥 <CN> Hope the media gang slow it down for the Behind The Blades no pressure....👍👍
<HS> Spider 🕸️ <CN> People applaud AWB for stopped this shot, but we don't need this performance from him if we have a proper CDM to stop Trincao first #ManUtdneedsrealCDM
<HS> I M P A C T 🤝 <CN> YES
<HS> It’s no surprise someone with this mentality would feel threatened by the arrival of Ronaldo. If you’re complaining about the demands BEFORE Ronaldo, you’ll never survive alongside him. Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <CN> If this is come from Maguire, then is clear why we never win anything after he join us 😂
<HS> what a piece of shit <CN> that's ronaldo fan for you they're shameless
<HS> Im just done at this point ull burn in Hell <CN> Don't know about the kidnapping let's wait what happens
<HS> You fucking illiterate. Dullard <CN> L
<HS> As the owner of two 11-year-old cats, fuck you <CN> My living 12 year old man and my now departed 12 year old Ragdoll agree
<HS> Just a shit Declan Rice <CN> I mean it’s a funny comment. Let’s all be less sensitive.
<HS> Do you even know the meaning of that word you fake Brazilian? <CN> Please help us to educate him warey
<HS> GET THE FUCK OUT THIS YOU WANKER! <CN> Don’t fall into the trap mate, H has been made a scapegoat for this shit he see it a mile off
<HS> Another England International escapes punishment. Kicks him when he was down. Disgusting from . #LFC #CHELIV <CN> I’m a Liverpool fan and there was nothing in it. Kostas was grabbing his legs anyway
<HS> Another scummy footballer strikes again. Kurt Zouma terrorising a poor Cat by kicking and slapping the Animal. You are a vile human being nothing clever about what you did just shows people what you are all about. The list keeps coming with these tossers <CN> Perhaps someone should do it to him, what a disgusting person. And of course he’s come out and apologised , because he’s been caught
<HS> "We don't care about Ronaldo in India" What a joke Can't expect more from a retard <CN> I am right? Rohit sharma is 100x bigger than messi/ronaldo in India. Not even 1% of our population follow football
<HS> Rashford is very fucking bad and he’s very fucking stupid LEAVE <CN> das not you g.
<HS> you’re so shit mate <CN> This obsession
<HS> are you watching this? This is what defending for is You fucking slab head leave my club right now! The management have already wasted 100 mills on you SHAME! #mufc #manutd #manchesterunited #MaguireOut <CN> big head
<HS> If isn't sent off the ref has been paid off, cheating arse whole <CN> Imagine being that pissed off that you mistake hole for whole 😂😘 was a complete joke though and definitely deserves a peggin'
<HS> i don’t like you <CN> You should not. I did not like Henry. But I knew he was the best.
<HS> Me n my dawg say FUCK YOU <CN> they are some wet ass shoes
<HS> I’d firm a wheelchair for a year if it meant #10 could never walk again. just chop off your legs please darg <CN> 5 30 and rashford is on your mind yh get help
<HS> You deserve no respect <CN> nothing but failure to this club
<HS> Surprised Maguire doesn’t have his fingers in his ears. Useless fucker <CN> Is that the 1 and only in back ground
<HS> I see the kicking a poor defenceless animal across the room has been turned into a race row. The truth is, he is a cruel b**tard and simply has to be sacked by . Wherever he plays now will result in him getting abuse. Kurt, if youre reading this, resign today. <CN> As a nation we tend to forgive and forget the misdemeanours of politicians, celebrities, sportsmen (and women) etc, but as nation of animal lovers, hmm not so much. His actions will live with him and us for a very long time!
<HS> Messi is the actual goat you fraud <CN> How is Messi the goat when ronaldo has done it in the premier league and is about to do it again
<HS> This is only the footage we HAVE seen - you evil bastard what haven’t we witnessed you do to your poor animals - shame on you tonight <CN> When are you boys coming to NEW ZEALAND????
<HS> Leading by what examples?I beg can shut the hell up. No one give a damn what he says. <CN> Leading by example on how to get locked up abroad
<HS> You're fucking shit. I really pray you fail in whatever you do in life <CN> He has achieved more than martial ever will 😂
<HS> U guys r so dead. Chill out <CN> You have other things to worry about Bimz 😂
<HS> Van Dijk doesn't know you like that you pigeon <CN> Crying he plays in the prem with tha ball knowledge
<HS> Simply; jog on already. Youre a waste of sperm. <CN> How is that lying and that took you 45 minutes 😂😂😂😂
<HS> Maguire sleeping again! Get this f**king clown out of our club! Supposed to be our captain but doesn’t know how to defend! <CN> Nah, that’s great attacking players, VVD concedes that
<HS> Our fanbase are an absolute DISGRACE!!! Don’t try tell me Paul Pogba gets ‘fair’ treatment from some of you pussies!!!! Had to remove a picture of him praying cos of abuse by his own fan base!! You are a shit stain on society’s arse!! We love you 💙 <CN> At this point he has every right to leave, wouldnt blame him, Xenophobia FC back again
<HS> loser <CN> Are you judge and jury ?
<HS> Hey I will sit on your face of you score a brace🥺 <CN> nobody wants those fat cheeks on the face
<HS> [BODY] You’re thick as fuck you mate… <CN> [BODY] 😂😂 I’d be depressed too if I had a hairline like that
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> Cannot believe they’re actually allowing him to play. Sets an awful precedent of what is acceptable.
<HS> P I C K. T H A T. O U T!🔥 #CFC <CN> The technique was utterly magnificent 🔥🔥
<HS> Fuckoff Matty <CN> Diddums.
<HS> Fuck WBA <CN> I second that emotion.
<HS> [BODY] Fucking hell Tony, it’s accepted <CN> [BODY] Why does it have to change its mom
<HS> Why the time in soccer is not stopped like any other sport on the planet? Imagine a World Cup final, billions of dollars involved, the history of two Nations: 1 x 0 for someone, they start to fall on the ground and pretending they are hurt like an anti-ethical piece of shit. 🤣 <CN> Why did Mercedes not also changed the tyres like the Red Bull did? Lewis did not lose because of the safety car, he lost because he was with a 36 laps-old hard tyres against a 1 lap-old soft tyres. And that is the beautiful of the sport, ok my friend?
<HS> I wonder what has to say about this. Also, fuck Aboutrika. <CN> He agrees
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> It is CLEARY orchestrated, the person filming told him “sa commence” - (its started) so he knew when to begin his assault. Not that that makes things any better for him, worse if anything!!
<HS> Bro you a real stupid ass bih <CN> Need him in jail asap
<HS> Shame on you <CN> Don’t think he’s done anything wrong
<HS> Well done Career down the drain because you are despicable 👍 Hope you’re released later today. <CN> Newcastle will have him, for a fee.

<HS> Devastated that will win the league. What a prick. <CN> We will have to give him the guard of honour as well.😭
<HS> the worst fucking player I hope u break ur legs you ugly ducking garbage kid <CN> since your so annoyed why don’t you come on for them in the second half weird behaviour ..
<HS> rather be dead than be a mag <CN> If you wanna die rather than being a mag there is always Ethanasia
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> Keep the clip trending, let’s not let him/others change the reality of what happened! I’m disgusted with the whole situation!
<HS> Im sure will find a way to punish Mason Greenwood again for latest fuck up. <CN> Boom boom boom, let me hear you say Victim......Victim 🤣
<HS> way to be a piece of crap, <CN> That’s a mansion?
<HS> What a nasty little shite is. Here is hope prosecutes and sacks him. #AnimalCruelty <CN> I can't share that as I feel sick seeing it. Absolutely agree he must be sacked and prosecuted.
<HS> you're a real p.o.s , what you did to that cat was discusting <CN> Horror, how can someone do that 😣
<HS> Thrown away your own career. Broken United fans hearts. Destroyed the life of a young woman. Fuck you <CN> nice job, I'm going to BURN his shirt, I'm embarrassed that I actually spent money and bought his shirt.
<HS> People defending need to sort their fucking life out. The blokes a fucking predator, a rapist. <CN> Be careful - live case. Contempt rules in place.
<HS> You're trash <CN> for everyone in the comments, stan CHO
<HS> Fuck you <CN> Has he reported it??? 😂
<HS> Please leave my club <CN> Your club? Lmfao, you have contributed absolutely nothing to the club. Fred on the other hand is actually a part of the club
<HS> Fuck off and sign Ronaldo <CN> no
<HS> doesn’t give a flying fuck and you know what I can’t blame him, he’s seen how bad this side is for 3 years. Failed by a poisonous little rat of a chairman!!! <CN> He is just as bad and unprofessional don’t defend him he is there to do a job not like he doesn’t get paid well. If you and I performed like Kane and whole team did we would be sacked. No defence for him or any other player today.
<HS> Okay. These players who are leaking these shits can fuck off please. Please fuck off your asses from this club. @ <CN> I doubt Rashford is among the players , it’s mainly Greenwood and Maguire
<HS> Even with the assault being a alleged offence the audio proof of you trying to force her to have sex is disgusting horrible creature you are...what a waste 🤬 <CN> Cant be a first
<HS> i’ll never forgive you. <CN> i dont forgive YOU
<HS> [BODY] He's just an ungrateful twat lad 😂 <CN> [BODY] Only think he deserves is that ratio
<HS> Ur embarrassing <CN> Where's your UCL?
<HS> Yo , you little entitled waste of oxygen. You've always had an attitude problem and you're easily most vile thing on the planet at the moment. You should never see a football pitch again unless it's in prison. Scum. <CN> Am I sad? Yes. Am I shocked? No.
<HS> Not sure what is worse. kicking the cat or that child offering the cat to get slapped. Two very disturbed individuals who could potentially do worse in the future <CN> The child’s actions are also down to the parents.
<HS> Deserves jail time and to never own a pet again in his life. 😠😞 <CN> Absolutely vile but apparently found it funny….
<HS> shit keeper <CN> Fuck you

<HS> It's over for Mason Deadwood even before he has reached the level of Bukayo Saka. Shame on You <CN> Nah man it’s wrong to make this about football. This should be about the girl who was abused and the action taken against Greenwood. I love Saka to pieces but we are not making this abt him
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> Omg !!!!!!! This is brutal, this guy has issues

<HS> You are absolutely fucking useless mate <CN> Don't say these things to our own players. What kind of fan are you. No matter what you think, it's really not good to openly and directly insult them right under their own tweet. You back your team and all of the players. He needs support or say nothing. This wont help!
<HS> Shit player Solly March clear <CN> Shut up face rat
<HS> I swear you need to be flogged <CN> No0b
<HS> FAK off with the apology la bastard <CN> If he’s still the captain on the next game or so on, blame it on Ole. If the world can see how bad he is or not the level that utd wants then i dont understand why Ole cant see that.

<HS> Fuck off you dirty, cheating cunt. <CN> My mate a Spurs fan said the only reason he wasn't sent off was because he got the ball, Robbo didn't.... Anyone got the footage proving this?
<HS> Horrific and shameful! If he does this on camera, what does he do off camera?! Remove the animals and prosecute this person. I’m beyond disgusted.Animals deserve a safe home! This is NOT one! #KurtZouma <CN> Met have already said they don't care.

<HS> I Think should donate at LEAST a months wages to an animal charity - Then work at LEAST 100 hours for that charity #Shameful #Coward <CN> His statement “[..] I would like to assure everyone that our two cats are perfectly fine and healthy. They are loved and cherished by our entire family [..]” If that’s him loving and cherishing, I’d h8 to see him disliking an animal. Who TF wrote that shite for him. Disgraceful.
<HS> How the fuck has Michael Antonio turned this into a debate about racism? Fuck sake. Anyone whose racist should be banned. Just like anyone who cunts their cat across their kitchen should be banned. - both are totally unacceptable. <CN> They are not changing any subject, Zouma has been punished, fined 250k and lost a sponsorship deal, maybe you guys are expecting a death penalty… well that’s not a big deal to you people over blacks

<HS> You’re shit but your sisters fit 🎶 <CN> Mate she’s 14
<HS> Are you a fraud? 🤔 You have zero goals zero assists this season 🤔🤔 <CN> Isn’t he a holding midfielder? Goals aren’t his job. How many non penalty goals does Jorginho have?

<HS> midget prick <CN> the sexual frustration must be unreal looking like that tbf
<HS> We slag off Pogba's agent for protecting his player but this limp twat is allowing a 2nd Division Manager to completely take the piss out of his client. get yourself a new agent pal, this one's allowing your career to be ruined by a incompetent waste of space. <CN> Feel sorry for VDB, he wants to play just like Dan James yet we have wasters like Martial & Lingard happy to sit on their arses & taking the dollar.
<HS> You should have included yourself there too so everyone can know it better that you are a shithead dude . You watch PL ? <CN> Chill it is his personal opinion.
<HS> Maguire should be the first player to follow OLE out of the club the slabhead bastard. Leave the club you abysmal state of a footballer <CN> Worst player in the premier league by far hth

<HS> LEAVE BOZO UR SHIT <CN> Not funny
<HS> Just saying if you call yourself a Norwich fan and then go onto racially abuse our players you most definitely aren’t a Norwich fan. Absolutely disgusting. All with you . #ncfc <CN> He's not a Norwich fan. He's from France and was angry at Idah because he cost him money on his sports bet.
<HS> This is how you treat animals, in particular cats. Kindness & love. Take note You absolute scum bag, deserve every ounce of abuse you’re going to get after abusing that cat. Evil weasel. <CN> Comparing him to a weasel is a bad look for weasels. Guys a parasite
<HS> Marcus Rashford should never play for Utd again after that though, I am embarassed to be Manc with the effort and attitude shown if you dont want to be here FUCK OFF <CN> Don't be stupid.
<HS> As a Manchester United fan I will be disgusted if ever plays for us again. Show him the door #MUFC <CN> Vile and disgusting, should never be seen in public again nevermind on a football pitch
<HS> and we let this guy go out on loan? Absolute cess pit of a club this season <CN> Dunno why managers keep playing him at fullback. Replaced a full back on Saturday but he should be playing further upfield 🤷🏼‍♂️
<HS> The attitude of some of these United players is a disgrace. one of the worst for it, fucking sulking on the pitch. Fuck off if you don’t like it <CN> Tell him Ry

<HS> If you commented under post last night because you didn't like what he tweeted, then you ain't Chelsea and you're a sad sad little mug who needs to grow up and take a long hard look at yourself. <CN> Very very new fans I'd say who were probably supporting city till the champions league final and then jumped ship
<HS> Covid is a h0ax <CN> Trump got banned from Twitter and fb for saying such dangerous misleading things.

<HS> [BODY] You literally called him “nig” then say he’s going to play the race card, you’re the dumbest person I’ve ever come across. <CN> [BODY] Do you understand future tense? Have a look at his previous tweets, you helmet. You're a kid who cannot comprehend basic English grammar. Work on your reading comprehension and gain some football knowledge.

<HS> I think you have to have a fairly disgusting and remorseless person to abuse a defenseless animal like did. Makes you wonder how they torture it when the camera's are off. <CN> The level of toxicity from these high earning footballers can be seen from space. Millionaires in their teens and no sign of empathy or compassion.
<HS> It’s an absolute disgrace but sort of sums up the new era of football. All about money and they’ll use something like ‘we need to stand by our man, it’s up to the authorities to do their job, not us’. Shame on shame on shame on You’re all scum <CN> All Watford, aren’t we?! ✊🏻
<HS> Get Anthony Martial out of Manchester United. I’m sick of his lazy, selfish USELESS performances. All of our fans seem to suck him off. HES SO BAD. LEAVE OUR YOU USELESS FUCK. <CN> 🚫 Support players 🚫 ✅ Abuse them ✅

<HS> How can you “mix up” the absolutely unforgettable with anyone unless you are, at best, utterly, completely and totally useless ? <CN> And how little must he have been paying attention to what Itoje said?
<HS> You’re not having at villa!! Get lost <CN> He wants champions league footy Tanya, so it's Chelsea or Inter, at the moment!
<HS> We support you that fat twat will be gone soon mate and you will be happy again <CN> You joking? If he doesn't want to tow the line he can pack his bags and leg it
<HS> Fuck off with this. Tired of hearing all this bullshit from you lot every fucking week. How have you not learned to come off your line yet? <CN> Come off it drew, he’s only 31.. he’s a young keeper, he’s got plenty of time to learn to come off his line 👀🤥

<HS> it's because you're a shit footballer mate. Get over yourself and get out of this club. You are a championship player. Stick to your level. <CN> You believing an article from the Discomirror?
<HS> I Think should donate at LEAST a months wages to an animal charity - Then work at LEAST 100 hours for that charity #Shameful #Coward <CN> Whatever he does, he will need to be very public about it. Not just an Instagram or Twitter post. Needs to do a huge amount of work if he wants to turn this around.
<HS> If you generally believe is being targeted for hurting that poor animal is purely a racist attack please block me or unfollow me. I don’t have any interest in socialising with any idiot that truly believes it. <CN> Can’t believe he’s been included to play again this weekend - board of Directors & Management bringing their club into disrepute ! Very sad sad & sickened !
<HS> Let's be clear here. There's regular substitution ennui. Players don't like to be replaced, nor should they. And then there's 'How dare you take me off, I'm the greatest player of all time!' grown child bollocks. <CN> I was an unused sub last Saturday. I kept my coat on, stayed warm, ready for action. No complaints, do it for the team. Took a kick at the cat when I got home. Missed. Unused sub for a reason.
<HS> You are FAKE just wish you could leave our team you are the worst buy we have ever made ... <CN> tell Ralph to bench maguire till both depart OT

<HS> If I were you I would simply be grateful for being free in society, never mind being a regular starter for one of the biggest football clubs in the world and not moan about being subbed off for a CB in the 80th minute when my team is 2-0, you asinine piece of shit. <CN> You've made 10 tweets about Ronaldo in the last hour pal, your beyond obsessed, get some rest.
<HS> If a woman can abuse a horse and get arrested then what’s the difference ? #scum 🤬🤬🤬🤬 <CN> None apart from apparently you can't tell professional football off for being naughty or breaking the rules
<HS> [BODY] You’re literally the one crying on a Twitter page because they didn’t include anyone from your shite team 🤣 support your local, ya fucking kenyan <CN> [BODY] Right two things mate. Number one - if I’m a Londoner and I support Chelsea. I think that classes as supporting my local team as they’re in my home city. Number two - ain’t we the same “shite” team who just demolished you lot 3-0 last week? 🤔 Guy is so uneducated it’s unreal.
<HS> should terminate contract with immediate effect. What this disgusting man has done is one of the most sinister acts a human is capable of performing. Cruely to animals on any level should carry custodial sentences. <CN> Well said that man, couldn’t agree more👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻. Now let’s all share our disgust about grooming gangs…silence.
<HS> You’re finished Pervertz <CN> Ratio then

<HS> Day two I hate there look of your face and hope your acl tears to bits <CN> Hold that

<HS> What utter trash is for attacking a defenceless animal. I hope you’re investigating and have safely removed his pets? #lowestofthelow #RSPCA <CN> meowww lovers
<HS> you join your sick friend in prison you sick fuck why aren’t ye reporting this? Because he’s English If this was Paul Pogba it would be on fucking every news Channel <CN> Because at the moment it’s a twitter based allegation. They have to be careful or they get sued. If true though, send him down for life
<HS> He should be locked up for animal cruelty. I wonder how would feel being slapped & kicked around his kitchen. <CN> Should throw the book at him. Hopefully he will get whats coming.
<HS> What a disgrace you are what you did to your defenceless cat is disgusting <CN> Shit man I actually liked him. I was a chelsea fan and I remember after his injury I felt so bad. I even followed him when he left chelsea and was excited to see him back on the blues a couple years later. And was happy for him on WH. I always rooted for that guy. This sucks.
<HS> Forgive Zouma? F**k you Moyes. get the hell out of our club. Do you think it’s the first time he’s done that to that poor cat? Ful**k no. And I don’t believe for a second he limits his physical abuse just to animals. He’s not a hammer. #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> Yes, please crucify Zouma, you perfect vegan human.

Fucking poes <CN> This guy can do fokol wrong in the sight of English media. Rest of the World " reckless, and studs showing, endangering another player" English media "brilliant old school football challenge, he's world class" 😡😡😡

<HS> Get the fuck out of this club and focus on your PR stunts and your career as an author knobhead Hope this helps <CN> Brudda, they wanted a reaction, they got one. Big whoop
<HS> You're a "brave" man for kicking your cat. Disgusting piece of sh*t. <CN> The worst type of human being , someone who is capable of abusing a defenceless animal is capable of anything

<HS> Maguire needs to go. Absolute liability <CN> Get rid of Maguire & Shaw for starters, Rashford squad player, hate to say it but Ronnie is in the wrong league now, needs to be in the MLS or France.
<HS> Why is Zouma allowed in that line up? Clearly shows that some people don't consider animal cruelty and an obviously sadistic mindset for other forms of life as part of a deficient personality lacking the most basic sensibilities. Once again, fuck you . 🖕🏼 <CN> Real suprised by that. I thought at the very least he'd be left out of the squad for some time, but clearly West Ham "handling the matter internally"means fuckall & they'd rather have a sorry excuse of a human represent them without any repercussions. Disgusting.
<HS> Get that animal out of <CN> What happened?
<HS> Fuck Binance. scamming fucks. <CN> Join this group and thank me later 👇👇👇
<HS> Fuck off Atkinson! Denied us 2 clear penalties and gave one to West Ham that was clearly not a pen! to the rescue! <CN> To be fair, there’s was a pen. But that last tackle on Ronaldo in the box was a clear penalty.

Getting benched against league leaders wasn't enough to be embarrassed about I guess. Keep crying finished bozo🤡 <CN> Did factos really hurt you? 😂 majority of that post is his stats, & agrees the likes of Lewandowski should be ahead of a more quiet year for messi. Messi a 🐐 but its not unreasonable to ask why tf he got the award this year

What kind of person attacks a cat like this? , kick him off your team to send a message that animal cruelty is never acceptable. 😡 Pls RT so the world knows what he's done. <CN> Vile and violent behaviour- in front of a child! If you can treat an innocent and defenceless creature in this way, then you have it in you to treat another human like this also. This should be an arrestable offence. And the cameraman laughing- seems like it’s usual behaviour.

Imagine a World Cup final, billions of dollars involved, the history of two Nations: 1 x 0 for someone, they start to fall on the ground and pretending they are hurt like an anti-ethical piece of shit. 🤣 <CN> Why did Mercedes not also changed the tyres Like the Red Bull did? Lewis did not lose because of the safety car, he lost because he was with a 36 laps-old hard tyres against a 1 lap-old soft tyres. And that is the beautiful of the sport, ok my friend?

<HS> your sister's still a spastic and still can't wipe her own arse <CN> Mate. 😂
<HS> . tonight look out for me in lower G, seat 155 giving you the wanker signal. There's not much you can do about that either <CN> You want to wank off Harry Wilson?
<HS> You are absolutely fucking useless mate <CN> Anyone that wears the shirt shouldn’t get abused end of as we get behind our players, certainly players that care and Arthur is one of them.
<HS> Marcus rashford, an absolute disgrace you do this. No passion, no desire, no effort. Hopefully you leave the club. Backed you for so long and you treat the fans like this. Entitled prick. <CN> his fall off is pathetic and sad
<HS> It’s time tonight to go back to being a bully ! <CN> We need battle of the bridge spirit. I wanna see some fight and passion!
<HS> Comparing animal cruelty to racism?! you are a bit thick! <CN> He’s made a good point you might be a bit thick if you do t get it!
<HS> Embarrassing. Fuck off. You don’t deserve to play for Tottenham <CN> Ndombele may as well pack his bags. Only real creative player and he doesn't get on. Yet dele and his shit hair manage to start again.
<HS> Sick disgusting vile piece of shit along with whoever held the cat up and whoever filmed it should be taking some serious action here <CN> The police should take action here
<HS> Fuck you <CN> ooo someones butthurt. He prob spanked your team back in the days huh?
<HS> Maguire needs to go. Absolute liability <CN> Go check out!!! The P2E Function is giving guaranteed income💰and maximum fun time😎| is already showing crazy progress🔥check their TG if you don't believe me #metaflokirush #metaflokirushshillsquad #metaflokirushtothemonn
<HS> Hey , next time I see u taking a penalty kick knowing CR7 is in the field, I’m whooping ur silly ass. Do not ever try that shit again! <CN> I no fit understand that guy sef. 😔🥺🥺
<HS> Absolute bollocks. Tired of reading this BS. <CN> Week in, week out, it's the same story. We need to improve. But none of them speak where improvement is needed. I doubt if anyone; the manager, the coaches and the captain, actually checks on what went wrong. Same story different version, every week.
<HS> We don’t deserve u Harry <CN> We didn't deserve that sort of performance either ! HE ISNT BLAMELESS ! Our best players need to stand up and be counted. Conte should be booting a few arses in that dressing room. But we all know most fans will just blame the same players as they do ever week !
<HS> Shut up <CN> Looool bodied regulardon
<HS> You are the worst player i have ever see fuck you <CN> seen* aq
<HS> Get out of my team dont wanna see you tomorrow <CN> Would never have guessed your location 🚮🚮

<HS> well done , you just did the impossible in making a fanbase that already hated you hate you even more 👍 you’re a disgrace to City and football in general, hope you rot in prison you ugly twat <CN> I live outside UK so it doesn't apply to me but
<HS> Anyone who thinks is a palace legend need to listen to his punditry on today. Biased , Judas Brighton scum. Always will be! #CPFC <CN> Great tweet.
<HS> Another one who doesnt wanna be at the club … there is the door richy lad join the snake 🐍 <CN> How can you call him a 🐍 He’s been a brilliant player for our club. Always puts in 110%. Passionate player, such a good person and so good with the fans etc too. He’s an amazing player who deserves to go where he can win stuff too. Sad if he goes but not a 🐍 for it.
<HS> shut the fuck up and get better <CN> Fans like you are such hypocrites it’s crazy.
<HS> Score a goal or I’ll shave my head <CN> Auba just robbed him of an assist ffs
<HS> Martinez is shit, the only reason he's good at is taunting and getting into the opponent's head during penalties. you're just another shit Ramsdale <CN> Don’t shit on ramsdale he was keeper of the week for me
<HS> pecat aja pemain bad attitude macam Greenwood Fuck you <CN> Men learn to not allow your emotions get the better of you, kindly rt for other men to see
<HS> Do the right thing and put that animal abusing scum bag on the street. Absolutely disgusting, i hope he's prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. <CN> You didn’t even tweet about Mason Greenwood 😂😂😂😂
<HS> Ole’s job was safe and intact until you joined Manchester United. Shut up you fraud. <CN> Ur face basaaaa take dey diss someone
<HS> guess what? You’re a nigger 🤣🤷‍♂️ <CN> yo
<HS> Are you disappointed that you trusted him fans - meet the word twisting weasel Wish him a Merry Christmas <CN> Read the interview, his words aren’t “twisted” whatsoever. He gave honest answers rather than cliched nonsense. Re headline, it’s a grab of one element, as all headlines are. And he did say teams have worked Leeds out & Bielsa won’t change because he’s stubborn. Which is true!
<HS> All snakes <CN> Why do you care your Scottish?
<HS> Happy Birthday you prick 🥳🥳 <CN> ❤️💙😘
<HS> rat <CN> Really is a scouser then, rats everywhere.
<HS> I’ll back the lad when he helps us land a 13th place finish because he’s so shit, stop defending shit management you twat <CN> I'm going to turn notifications on for your posts and if I ever catch you saying a good word about him I am going to remind you of this every single day until you promise to never give another opinion
<HS> Get the fuck out of this club and focus on your PR stunts and your career as an author knobhead Hope this helps <CN> What did he say? I cant hear anything
<HS> I’m sick of bastards like you abusing animals, how dare you do that to an animal in your care, and laughing!!! I hope you get jailed, you nasty evil piece of shit <CN> Jailed?? Chill
<HS> Total disrespect and disgrace deserves more respect after all he has done for the club, you just don’t disrespect him like that your pussyole <CN> 😂😂😂😂 Tony they be no discrimination, yet they actually don't know what it means mtcheee
<HS> Embarrassing <CN> Just about sums up their players.. 🙄
<HS> Absolutely sickening should be absolutely ashamed of himself and should banish him from the team. No place for animal cruelty. Imagine being so hard you kick lumps out of your cat! Disgusting to see. #Zouma #WestHam #KurtZouma <CN> Hopefully he is taken in for questioning under the animal welfare act and the culprit laughing whilst recording this video is also named and shamed. Absolutely horrific viewing. #whufc

<HS> Been excited for for a while now. The potential to be one of the brightest strikers of this generation and then he turned out to be a despicable fucking asshole! Fuck this kid, doesnt deserve to put on United shirt. <CN> Kashmir will be free by the mercy of Allah SWT before Ghazwa e Hind happens. Imam Al-Mahdi will save the people of Kashmir in the near future to come. This is Muhammad Qasim’s dreams and many are coming true. Learn more at or watch
<HS> ⁦⁩ Pretty obvious who the fucking animal is. If I say what I actually think I will be called a racist. Scum. <CN> The Hag has spoken.
