<HS> Aside FPL I don’t think I’d like u <CN> I'm a man united fan but you just have to like greatness.
<HS> I’m hearing the scumbag is a patron of a lion sanctuary? I suggest if he ever wants to play football in this country again he goes into the sanctuary and volleys a fully grown lion? Then I will forgive him <CN> I can’t believe West Ham are actually playing him tonight saying that they’ll deal with it afterwards. What sort of message is that sending out?
<HS> West Ham player filmed violently kicking his cat. Doesn’t he understand difference between a simple animal and a football? Horrible man should be prosecuted <CN> Careful Andy, nearly all of West Ham supporters vote tory…
<HS> Words cannot describe how much hate I have for you <CN> Can't imagine I follow this imbecile, damn.

<HS> How about keeping more than one Clean Sheet mf? If you're put in the transfer list, nobody, I mean, NO[BODY]YYY is gonna come in for you. That's how shit you are. <CN> This you d*ckhead?
<HS> Just seen the video of kicking and slapping his cat. I’m angry, sickened and so sad. How anyone can do this to an animal is beyond me. Horrible human. #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> You’re right - but you address him as human? You’re being very kind!!

<HS> Shut up nigga <CN> Ok
<HS> These are the type of players that we want out of the club immediately.. You're a disgrace <CN> You are wrong to blame Lingard on this. He wanted to leave because of lack of game time, there were clubs who wanted him but United could not agree on a deal and they hardly use him. Is it now that they need him
<HS> Sociopathic vile scum of the earth <CN> Not sure what it is with footballers thinking they can just get away with anything cause of the money they're on. Proper bellends some of them lad.

<HS> Pack Prealish you're fraud player <CN> Get a life hater
<HS> . what a piece of shit scum you are. Fucking disgusting. You should be banned from ever having pets again. Rotten. <CN> He shouldn't just be banned from having pets, he should lose his job and face criminal charges - disgusting
<HS> Dear Greame Souness Please F**K OFF from & from our screens you utter moron! I am getting sick of your anti & anti views! It was a 50/50 ball with & lets be honest, you were a f**king thug when you played! #DryYourEyes #WOLMUN #MUFC <CN> Going to say the same about Roy Keane and Robbie Keane? How dare they say something you don’t like
<HS> Rashford talks about his love for the club but he doesn't show it. He doesn't give his all. All he care about is his ego. Fvck you honestly <CN> He feeds poor kids. Do you?
<HS> please have a painful slow dea*h <CN> Tears

<HS> Piece of shit. 🖕🏻 <CN> Holly shit 😳😳😳
<HS> #westhamunited ANYONE touches a cat again from your team and I will personally fly across the ocean and break every one of your goddamn legs so NO[BODY] will play football ever again. Serious - ANY CAT KICKER'S LEGS WILL BE BROKEN. <CN> If it happens with any animal, we will join you on your endeavors with a metal pipe, a 9mm or 2.

<HS> #Catslivesmatter you evil man. You are a coward by abusing a defenceless animal is totality inexcusable and for the twat that filmed it I have no words. I expect you to at least give a month’s salary to an animal charity and I hope the take action. <CN> He really must be charged by RSPCA or it gives the right to so many of his ilk who are even now getting away with cutting animals throats (cats and dogs) for sacrifice. Why are our laws not to be observed by a certain race and religion what’s going on in our dear country?
<HS> It's called football fking American Go play Fortnite. <CN> A simple explaination for Americans
<HS> Get. To. fuck. <CN> Morning Simon 😂😂

<HS> Except that it’s a scam <CN> There are so many more red flags to this too.
<HS> This is so shameless. Literally defending their own skin colour even if they have committed such a disgusting act and then excusing it by saying white people have done worse. You’re disgusting <CN> You can get away with murder by crying racism these days.
<HS> You're a "brave" man for kicking your cat. Disgusting piece of sh*t. <CN> West Ham must take a stand and both drop this idiot and place a massive fine on him
<HS> YOU FUCKING SUCK. YOU DONT BELONG. ID RATHER KEEP MAGUIRS THAN YOU. I FUCKING HAAATE YOU. FUCK OFF. OFF YO*****LF <CN> Its not that deep.

<HS> Yeah but for you only BLM matter, which means you're a joke. <CN> What do you mean by that? Does he only feed black children?
<HS> Im absolutely fuming seeing this man… Beating on a helpless defenseless cat, sick vile person <CN> I wish a miserable miserable death on this ugly bastard
<HS> As a Manchester United fan I will be disgusted if ever plays for us again. Show him the door #MUFC <CN> I’m sorry but do we actually know if it was all legit? Might not of even been him in that recording. Sorry but I just think it all needs to be investigated properly first 🤷‍♀️
<HS> [BODY] I'm not your brother. Cunt <CN> [BODY] Who invited you in the convo ? Get out of here
<HS> just wants more money. No one is bigger than if you don’t accept it you can leave. And become live Nobody. Goodbye. <CN> No one is bigger than , correct . It doesn’t mean club owners and fans should ride on that and treat players after they played their hearts out for the club . Imagine the likes of lukaku and Rashford earning more than salah .
<HS> Naughty <CN> Was it disallowed?
<HS> Knobhead 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 <CN> Who looks like a prick now 😂😂
<HS> Fuck me these footballers aren’t wired up properly. you’re twisted fella. Vile cunt. <CN> do us a favour and boot him up and down the training pitch.

<HS> you fucked it. could’ve been dancing at OT with ten hag. <CN> He'd have been better for you icl
<HS> And there goes another footballers career and life down the drain because of their self importance and utter disregard for other people. Well done to his ex for coming forward and showing the world what a coward he is. I hope you get banged up you utter cunt. <CN> Just shows that footballers aren’t and shouldn’t be viewed as role models
<HS> If a woman can abuse a horse and get arrested then what’s the difference ? #scum 🤬🤬🤬🤬 <CN> are scared of West Ham and taking in a player. They prefer the poor sod in the streets. Get the small guy!
<HS> Is what done worse than racism??? Yes! He has kicked and punched an animal that he is meant to cherish. In the same way child abuse or domestic abuse is worse than racism! Racism is still wrong but it’s not relevant here, fucking idiot him. #CatsLivesMatter <CN> It isn’t worse than racism, but the two topics had no business being mixed. They’re both horrible in their own way and should be punished according to the crime, not based on poor relevancy to the other
<HS> This man is Graeme Souness. A failed manager. He is Scottish and ex Liverpool; he has just suggested that should not play football ever again this season. This is now spiralling out control. Souness is a just a bloody racist hidden in a cat’s skin. <CN> What has this got to do with racism. Are you suggesting that Zouma is cruel to cats because he is black, because that is racist.
<HS> Sociopathic vile scum of the earth <CN> What am I missing?

Sort it oot man you little black and white buggers… #NUFC <CN> It’s probably the fact he could walk away in the summer after paying massive fees to get him to help secure our Premiership status. 🤞he wants to come for the long term
<HS> Fuck you <CN> Noooooo I didn’t even get a chance to see it
<HS> Not even sharing the video of that disgrace booting about a cat. Actually disgusting. Prick. <CN> Disgusting act of violence against a wee cat says a lot about his character or lack of it HH🍀

A club that gave his client a base to become the superstar he is . Fuckin weasel <CN> One thing i'll say Andy is Ramy works for Mo, Mo can stop him mouthing if he wants. Same as Raiola and Pogba. Any athlete/actor etc can phone up their agent and tell them to shut the fuck up and he's not doing that. Still love Salah but hes allowing Ramy to do this
<HS> Fuck u . Fuck u . Fuck u . <CN> Bit racist mate
<HS> So I wake up this morning to hear about kicking his cat about, I haven’t seen the video, but I later get a phone call and find out our family cat has been hit by a car and killed ! My kids will be devastated ! you are a Cnut ! <CN> Why aren't they taking Zouma's cat off hum as clearly its in danger and give to a deserving family like yours? I fear for that cat as I'm sure that wasnt the only time it's been abused.
<HS> What a man, what an arse <CN> Gotta win "rear of the year " this season 🤣🤣🤣
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> Scored from a corner at that end of the ground - what are they supposed to run back to the centre circle and celebrate there because in every cretin can’t control their actions
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> You threw a bottle at him you deserved it. He left because he was being treated poorly and you cry now.
<HS> You should be fucking ashamed <CN> I don’t agree with the players but this is embarrassing
<HS> sksksks see what you cause madman <CN> You caused it to yourself for rating a bum
<HS> Ur shit allow it <CN> Won't give martial a future at united
<HS> this piece of scum purports to be a #lufc fan. Identify & ban. Hatred towards our players should NEVER be tolerated. This is not banter or a football opinion it’s hatred and discrimination [BODY] <CN> [BODY] More evidence of this disgusting abuse
<HS> your career is over <CN> Have you heard from BOTH sides ?
<HS> No joke is wank simple 30 million pound player not 100 🤯🥴 <CN> He’s not a 100 million pound player, that was just his release clause and we was daft enough to pay it, he’s easily worth 40 mill
<HS> Snake <CN> OWN
<HS> get back to basic defending dickhead <CN> He needs to get his confidence back and not the basics. Harry is good as a defender but he needs a bit of a rest I think. He's not been the usual Harry we had from last season
<HS> Harry Kane did this to himself, he'll now stay there all his life, in a cell, 0 trophies, 0 accolades, UEFA conference league against part time plumbers, you did this to yourself Harold. <CN> Hes coming to united or real madrid
<HS> I think I speak on behalf of many when I say Fck off! <CN> It’s ok though because ole “reset the culture” at the club 🤦‍♂️
<HS> You’re a wasteman, leave my club please <CN> So many people need to go man but I'd say goat 🐐 first imo he's holding us back
<HS> Nothing infuriates me more than cruelty to innocent animals. you are a vile human being. <CN> If this was a villa player and he wasn't sacked, I genuinely don't think I could attend VP whilst he was still there
<HS> West Ham player filmed violently kicking his cat. Doesn’t he understand difference between a simple animal and a football? Horrible man should be prosecuted <CN> Possibly will be. Claiming it was an isolated incident is bull💩. West Ham say they don't condone animal cruelty I'm hoping they do more than not condoning it and take action against this no mark.
<HS> WE MISSED OUT ON SIGHT OF MS GEROGINA RODRIGUEZ FUCK YOU <CN> Mrs.*
<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> These jersey burnings are so silly. I mean it's already been paid for.
<HS> We don’t want you to be the captain anymore you twat <CN> Deh don't @ the player Mike, u might be sued or get arrested... Recently got one Singaporean Kenna charged for tweeting threats at a player in EPL
<HS> Please leave my club <CN> Your club? Lmfao Fred you have contributed nothing to the club, while Fred actually does
<HS> sir , not expected this from you , disappointed . You should block that c*nt Pogba in Instagram & stop talking to him completely. Paul Pogba would never ever be forgiven for his remarks towards India 🇮🇳🇮🇳 <CN> Chill pal he defended his relegion you would have done the same
<HS> Do u play football you dinner lady <CN> Shut it
<HS> What will you do if Barca is knocked out by Napoli after you waste so many chances!!!!! I hate you!!!!! <CN> Get a job

<HS> COME GET YOUR SHIT <CN> I need a wan bissaka trophy pic
<HS> , such a dickhead always throwing his weight around <CN> do you even know the context ?
<HS> We've just had 3 years of a dickhead bleating on about SAF as an excuse for his failure. We don't need anymore of it you microwave headed bastard. Hope this helps <CN> What are your thought on the 1920s economic boom in America ?
<HS> Robbery <CN> Foul on the keeper and should be a red for studs up
<HS> shut up <CN> ratio
<HS> 😒😒😒😒 <CN> Can’t believe he downgraded damn
<HS> All I can say is what a sick b*stard this “man” is! As a professional footballer, young people look up to him as a role model! Maybe role models like him are the reason this world is so messed up! you are a disgusting person & should be ashamed of yourself! <CN> What a filthy piece of low life shite
<HS> Ben white thought he could talk to the big boys because of 1 draw😭😭😭😭no man who ever calls himself Benjamin can mug us off. You’re jotas little bitch <CN> Benjamin chilwell does mate that the real Benjamin
<HS> There are many reasons I don’t like and this is the core . I can’t believe Ronaldo feels he deserves this award more than lewandowski. He’s a disgrace and a walking clown🤡. <CN> Leave them make dem Dey cry..
<HS> Just to be clear - booting and slapping a defenceless animal around the kitchen is WAY WORSE THAN RACISM. Why is this always the defence? Idiot. <CN> Way worse? Hnm..I'm sure you know lots of people have committed suicide out of making them feel less of humans like racists do?
<HS> I hope everyone knows how u think you're so 'tough' for kicking your cat across a room daily ?!!! You stupid piece of dirty shit.. <CN> Karen please get some help, wish you quick recovery 😂😂😂😂
<HS> I STILL can’t get over the #saka booking. I can take all the others coming from a jumped up little twerp with a narcissistic complex but why did #Atwell take so long to book any of the Man City fouls and the one for was mystifying #ARSMCI <CN> Didn’t like getting pushed in the box. Just a petty little man. Booked Holding for his first foul, let off Gundogan for a far worse one.
<HS> We’re getting ucl before u hold datt😹😹👎👎 <CN> Did you know when Arsenal last time qualify for UCL?
<HS> You disgust me - you are the lowest of the low and should face charges for what you have done. Horrific animal abuse. Complete scumbag <CN> Only sorry cos he got caught. Absolute scum
<HS> so if your name is you can make these leg breaking tackles and get away with it dirty bastard fuck you horrible twat I would love to meet you on a pitch believe me you wouldn’t walk off <CN> Stevo I’m sensing some anger issues 👍🏻
<HS> This shit is the same player who cried abt the online abuse a year back. And now he has grown so big that he is insulting every now and then. I m done with this academy lot and shit. <CN> Pogba if posted Juv pics would be destroyed by brexit media
<HS> You’re shit <CN> Benderson could of done better right
<HS> What a vile disgusting piece of shit you are Let’s hope your employers are equally as outraged! <CN> Shocking - please don’t let people think this is okay
<HS> ur scran is crap <CN> What on earth is that drink
<HS> Cow <CN> 😂😂😂I wanted to say kgomo. I knew I'd find my African brothers here
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> Best parody account out here
<HS> Absolute scum bags attacking Phil Foden and his family. Still the media try and twist it to make him look bad 😡😡😡😡😡 <CN> Could have just closed the door and job done.
<HS> Fuck off Atkinson! Denied us 2 clear penalties and gave one to West Ham that was clearly not a pen! to the rescue! <CN> you got 14 pen for free last season 🤷
<HS> Try and turn up in a big game for once you fraud <CN> Israel Jew is our Islamic Brotherhood Country Here in Pakistan Pakistan Army and ISI teach against other religions We all want to recognize Pakistani Israel Jews I am the only boy in Pakistan who raises voice for Israel Jews I don't care Pak Army and ISI?

<HS> You are shit <CN> You don’t know ball
<HS> You must have a shit life <CN> Earns 60k a week. Just scored and assisted for his boyhood club against their loocal rivals in a 3-1 pumping. Think he's doing alright actually. Much better than a bloke pretending to be a bird on twitter anyway. #shitlife
<HS> Get out of my team dont wanna see you tomorrow <CN> Location “Nigeria” not ur team. U ain’t even got a tv lad.
<HS> Go to hell .. arsehole <CN> He literally was the future Van Persie..
<HS> If you get an injury in future, please wait to get treatment on the pitch. Going off, or a yard from the touchline, will result in leaving your team mates an extra man down! We must be intelligent c**ts as Mourinho said! <CN> Ha ha Sanchez did everything to buy time including staying on the pitch despite the referee urging him off. He showed proper bottle and the fans loved him for it
<HS> Bam! Right in the… oh… the upper chest? That’s strange, ⁦⁩ , you were all like, “Oh, my face, my face; I think my jaw’s broken.” That’s called cheating by those of us in the non-cheating world. But you wouldn’t know about that because you’re a cheat. <CN> Don't forget Lacazette writhing on the ground and waving at the bench after Coufal's tackle. Jumped up and took the pen 30 seconds later. His reaction absolutely influenced the ref.
<HS> Tosser of the month award goes to David Moyes. Thinks starting was acceptable after his disgusting video of abusing a defenceless animal. What on earth does this show to the kids of today Moyes. A huge mistake by manager and club. <CN> What a club without class looks like.
<HS> Explain this u knobhead? <CN> Obviously his social media manager making a mistake its common logic
<HS> Nobody wants to hear your fucking waffle pal. 2 years of this. Shut up and focus on not dropping a disasterclass every single game. Hope this helps <CN> He is gonna start blocking fans now ffs💀
<HS> FUCK YOU <CN> Why hating on de Gea? I thought Norwich keeper did exactly what you people want de Gea to do and come off his line when he can just stay glued and stop the goal? 🤔
<HS> asshole for kicking your cat, someone must kick you, asshole <CN> Please let's go back and sign petition for this....it shouldn't be selective....
<HS> Aside FPL I don’t think I’d like u <CN> How’s your FPL week going so far?
<HS> Nah man arrest that cunt immediately and jail him holy shit you lowlife scumbag <CN> I'm trying my best to wait for a proper investigation before I render my own verdict but from what I've seen, there is just little to no way this guy isn't the lowlife criminal he looks to be.
<HS> you dirty cnut - I demand you investigate this now. You work for the public acknowledge my complaint and clear evidence of the animal abuse and inflicted pain. can we refund Kurt Zouma shirts <CN> Sorry mate apparently are too busy dealing with real crimes
<HS> Have you seen this sickening footage of kicking and abusing his defenceless cat.🤬😡 <CN> This POS obviously hasn’t watched “Don’t f**k with cats”. This will haunt him for the rest of his life, and rightly so
<HS> Filth, absolute filth. That flick, . 🔥 <CN> We've been treat to some beauties in 2022
<HS> Fat fucking fridge bet you was being used to keep the beers cold you rectangular bastard <CN> Why the Maguire hate pal you must be under the age of 12

<HS> Send all of the leaking British Toxic Mafia to the reserves, now! If we had any respect for fans they would have their contracts terminated. Disrespectful b4stards. You're all a disgrace. 🖕🏻 <CN> I'm not doubting you, just finding this all fascinating. How do you know it's those 4?
<HS> If Mason Greenwood had done that to my daughter you would be seeing his picture everywhere you looked with the word MISSING next to it because I’d move heaven and earth to get revenge. Horrible little scumbag. <CN> I’d rip his fucking lungs out
<HS> I'm slowly gay and it's your fault <CN> 😐
<HS> Im absolutely fuming seeing this man… Beating on a helpless defenseless cat, sick vile person <CN> Jail time.
<HS> Rashford Maguire yall should please fuck off this great club. <CN> Even generational talent rashford
<HS> When will sack this evil animal abuser, who is showing his child ho to abuse a defenceless cat. These poor pets deserve a safe loving home! What a scum bag <CN> Blacks tend to be more horrible towards animals. They tend to have less empathy on average than your average white European. Anyways this sort of stuff infuriates me.
<HS> Tell solskjaer to fuck off <CN> No fucking passion!

<HS> How useless is ? <CN> Please don’t insult useless bro 😎 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
<HS> Can we cancel already? Doing this to a cat i despicable enough, but to do it infront of their kid just goes to show what kind of person he really is. He ain't sorry he did it, he's sorry he got caught. <CN> People comparing the to Hazard- did hazards' friends videotape and and laugh while he did it? Did Hazard do with the assistance of a toddler prodding the boy up so he could kick him? Well, Zouma did. And it shows how callous it was.
<HS> Get tf outta my club you bum <CN> You no need to tag am. Chill

Do you know that sometimes the game changes so you need to change your tactics, 90' a lot can happen,sometimes the gaffer needs to change some players and the tactic as well, so it's perfectly fine to do subs

Disgusting to see. #Zouma #WestHam #KurtZouma <CN> Drama white people 🙄I see y'all nothing much here maybe it's ate his meal
<HS> How tf are still playing is beyond me. Do we really live in a world where people can abuse innocent animals and carry on like nothing happened? Zouma is scum. #ZoumaOut <CN> As opposed to a team that's owned by a regime that murders children?
<HS> Come back, we’re shit. <CN> he’ll make you worse 🤣

You big nosed twat... #gonzo #nosejob you may think twice before you try to incite the crowd good job it was only little Cambridge and not a big club who would of chased you and you're big snout and fat cunt of a manager out of town <CN> Well done for admitting, on Social Media, that you were part of it. this is one of the culprits. Ban him for life.

Maybe role models like him are the reason this world is so messed up! you are a disgusting person & should be ashamed of yourself! <CN> I think our footballers of today get paid to much money , they think their untouchable, whoever posted the video must have known it would’ve got this response, Or are they as horrible as Zouma, wanted pay back.

<HS> Get the fvck out of my 8 y.o club useless kid <CN> He plays for man united not city.
<HS> In my opinion, is a straight forward monster who should be prosecuted and sacked. If had been accused of this (some of his detractors might try next), then what would our MSM luvvies; our trades unions and our opposition politicians be saying/doing now? <CN> But still picked to play tonight, Disgrace!!
<HS> Fuck you <CN> He needs some bench time
<HS> Because Dan James is not English, Ole had to foster his exit. Fvck Ole man Jones and Lingard are still in the team and someone who works his ass out Sweats for the badge is sold I hate this useless PE teacher. All the best <CN> Lingard and Jones are on higher wages so so they are harder to get rid.
<HS> Watching tonight!!! Wow!! Absolutely bloody embarrassing! Just sell him in January please !! The guy is a disgrace! His work ethic is zero!! #pathetic #AtalantaManUtd <CN> He contributes so little. This is awful and just not good enough.

I feel for his girlfriend, I hope she is able to heal after this. Really hope this isn’t true but I’m fucking disgusted in . 😔 <CN> It’s down to a police investigation if they’ve been contacted. An see what happens to him then . It could be the end of him playing for a premier club he will end up abroad
<HS> Someone needs to teach a lesson. Absolutely disgusting human <CN> Glad I sold his card. Even as a passionate West Ham supporter, I can’t support behavior like that.
<HS> Leave my club forever you absolute mess <CN> Even copied the stadium photo lol mums basement dweller.

<HS> Get out of my team dont wanna see you tomorrow <CN> We’re not playing tomorrow.
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> And does his hit his kids and wife when upset too? Hope the RSPCA prosecute him, they have the evidence.
<HS> Speak English you penalty merchant <CN> You can translate the text to like many of us or learn Portuguese. And lastly drink some might help with the anger
<HS> Sorry you've been found out more like! What a horrible individual you are 🤬 <CN> Should be banned from ever owning an animal. Sorry me arse!! How many times was that poor cat abused off camera? 😢😡
<HS> #Catslivesmatter you evil man. You are a coward by abusing a defenceless animal is totality inexcusable and for the twat that filmed it I have no words. I expect you to at least give a month’s salary to an animal charity and I hope the take action. <CN> What about the child/ children who saw it? It is an act of domestic violence and children’s services should be in there
<HS> Man who's never lived in the North East talks shit on talkshit!! Same shit diffrent day with these asshats who've never been up here. <CN> man who has only seen newcastle from the Aston Villa team coach.

I know you are Messi fan, but now you are here and talking about United fan, give me a break. You are a shit deal. <CN> Interesting… burner account talking now. An uninformed burner to boot
<HS> I Think should donate at LEAST a months wages to an animal charity - Then work at LEAST 100 hours for that charity #Shameful #Coward <CN> Agree, but not one of the big charities. A small, local one who need the funds and work tirelessly helping animals.
<HS> TW // Sexual Abuse WTFFF ??? This is totally unacceptable. He should face the consequences for his actions! <CN> This guy is sick, SICK !!!

<HS> 🤣🤣🤣 I know it’s not funny but them pics are brilliant. Btw your scum <CN> I agree Zouma is a scumbag but don't you think it's hypocrisy when many of the people complaining about kicking a cat are the same people chewing on animals that have been tortured and killed?

<HS> As a Manchester United fan I will be disgusted if ever plays for us again. Show him the door #MUFC <CN> As a Man U fan also, I completely agree he should be sacked and charged- IF found guilty! Doesn’t look good for him though.
<HS> Scumbag cheater loser <CN> Hahah how is he a cheater? Lautaro literally took the advantage when he could just kick out the ball if the player was injured????
<HS> is a fucking disgrace too. Muggy prick <CN> I hope he goes in strike & doesn’t score another goal for us. He deserved to leave & win trophies, we ain’t a trophy winning club, we are a disgrace. I hope he walks about until his contract ends. Fuckkk Enic Fuckkk Levy Fuckkk Nuno Fuckkk Tottenham

<HS> Vile man!!! You hurt an animal that is the nastiest thing you could ever do!! I suggest you donate alot of your salary to the cats protection league! 😡😡😡 <CN> Animal cruelty is when you skin an animal alive to make football boots... Animal cruelty is when you slaughter defenceless animals for food (I'm sure you eat meat/fish). Animal cruelty is when you repeatedly hit innocent horses so they can run faster. Priorities mate

<HS> Mason Greenwood waving goodbye to his career. Will never play Premier League or International football again. Read those words shithead . <CN> Yep, now he'll find out what it's like to be cruelly shafted. Utter scumbag.
<HS> Get the fuck out of this club and focus on your PR stunts and your career as an author knobhead Hope this helps <CN> I’m the supporter he shouted at. Im not the one who shouted his name, I’m the one who shouted after that performance come on guys, (as in come over and sign the odd programme). disappointed that some of us spend a huge % of our ££ and time and get ignored, still love the guy tho
<HS> Tw <CN> Anyone else think this is sick...and I mean in the vomiting way.

<HS> Bam! Right in the… oh… the upper chest? That’s strange, ⁦⁩ , you were all like, “Oh, my face, my face; I think my jaw’s broken.” That’s called cheating by those of us in the non-cheating world. But you wouldn’t know about that because you’re a cheat. <CN> Encouraged to cheat by his shit house manager and refs who give imaginary fouls and penalties which courier VAR up hold and follow up with red cards. Awful club, awful ref.
<HS> How the hell did that Aston Villa shitbag get a job as a pundit. He is terrible plus everyone deserves there chance and I hope proves him wrong…..

<HS> False 9 is a variation of cf. Rtard doesn't know shit <CN> No argument can convince me Messi is a striker. He's never been a striker and if he played for any other team apart from Barcelona in his prime that fact would've been crystal clear. He's a trequartista best played in a 4-3-3 or 4-3-1-2. Don't be dumb

He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> Michael Jordan didn't make his Junior High team. A few years later a determined Jordan ignored everyone and showed the world what he could do as a basketball player. It's just a very tough age. Small steps will get you where you want to be. Ignore the noise of others and play on!

<HS> Fuxxake. Two totally separate things. is a wonderful example of what conceited, arrogant tw*ts some of these premier league ‘stars’ are. I hope him and West Ham get their fucking arses handed to them and dragged through the sh1t for how they’ve handled this. <CN> Ian Wright. Marlon king Troy deeney. All convicted and jailed. Not once was colour mentioned. Just the crimes.

Y'all can choke on your racism for all I care..including that bastard brand <CN> You won't die but live please. Kindly take this down.
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> Nope - that wasn’t over the top from Cash - players celebrate in front of oppo fans - it happens - doesn’t warrant bottles being thrown. Mind you, the bottle grazed his shoulder and he went down holding his head...
<HS> Nobody wants to hear your fucking waffle pal. 2 years of this. Shut up and focus on not dropping a disasterclass every single game. Hope this helps <CN> Where's Donny? You'll just blocking him out and never let him play wtf

<HS> You're absolutely shit mate, would appreciate if you leave in june <CN> Grow up
<HS> Seeing comments on hizab, sometimes I support the Racism against Black, somehow they deserved it. If you don't have knowledge on something don't do paid post for few thousand bucks. You moron France ban hizab many years ago what's your thoughts on that?? (1/2) <CN> You moron there are specific uniform in each college to avoid discrimination among rich and poor, Few month ago they used to come in uniform. We know you are not playing well you have money problems just you can beg it from Indian. No need to do paid tweets
<HS> Absolutely sickening should be absolutely ashamed of himself and should banish him from the team. No place for animal cruelty. Imagine being so hard you kick lumps out of your cat! Disgusting to see. #Zouma #WestHam #KurtZouma <CN> Sick sick cunt I hope he gets fucking jumped for this sick sick fucker
<HS> Stop making excuses for !! He is a rapist and deserves a very long jail sentence. The UK police should also investigate for a possible cover up given the reports that they knew about the assaults for months. Beyond disgusting! #masongreenwood <CN> If man United is found wanting for a “cover up”, I’m done with the club.
<HS> Mason Greenwood seen in public since the allegations. Police waiting for the rat 🐀 <CN> no be the Benz be this
<HS> well done , you just did the impossible in making a fanbase that already hated you hate you even more 👍 you’re a disgrace to City and football in general, hope you rot in prison you ugly twat <CN> I never hated him as footballer that's harsh.. He just wasn't that good after injury not his fault.. I'll despise him for this however if true
<HS> Is still rubbish? Asking for a friend …. <CN> No but that ankle needs looking after
<HS> I hate you both so much just leave my club <CN> cook mane
<HS> All time scumbag You shouldn’t be a part of society you lowlife <CN> Lol, ease up Montante
<HS> Rashford needs to fix up Asap the way people are talking on his name is sickening me, and he's allowing it. Stop being a bitch and play better. <CN> I don’t usually agree with you but I think on this one. You hate the nail on the head 👊
<HS> What is wrong with you !! Why are you protecting for abusing women, and permanently suspending someone that thinks this is disgusting!! Shame on you, are you gonna suspend me and rest of Twitter? You guys are disgusting!! <CN> Going to post this too if that’s ok mate
<HS> Piss off you backward mouth breathing c***. Poor oxygen. It must be cringing big time when you take a breath. Twat <CN> We can add verbal assault to the law suit too then.
<HS> FYI is a disgusting human being who not only abuses animals himself , but is teaching a child to abuse them also. There is a special place in hell for people like this. <CN> He shouldn't be allowed to own a pet and be required to pay for the upkeep of that cat.
<HS> Yet another guy who defends sexual & physical abuse. “It’s all about the money”, you inept maggot, course it is. ✊🏻💦 Maybe you should sit down with your mum & ask her to confirm your dumb af opinion. Proud no doubt. #masongreenwood #abuse #DomesticAbuse #notorape <CN> Look at all the attention you have!😍
<HS> work harder then you fraud <CN> He isn’t a fraud tbf
<HS> This man is our firmino replacement 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Get out you smelly Portuguese rat <CN> But #YNWA? 😒🙄
<HS> Kick this scum bag out of soccer like he kicked his cat around his house. Him and his family who laughed about it. And he calls himself Muslim! He doesn't know the first thing. Learn your Deen #Criminal #KurtZouma #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> And that is not the end of the world for him because the same Islam you talk about teaches forgiveness and where is that in you 🐈
<HS> wake your asses up bitches <CN> NO LITERALLY IM SO FURIOUS
<HS> You are bald <CN> You’re at least 40 and wear stone island.
<HS> The support by the is rather quiet. The most noise I heard out of them was in dismay at their own players or to boo at (who is a cunt) and walking out with 15 minutes still to go is just disrespectful. <CN> Can you blame him for Wanting to win stuff Earning more money Not having to live near Leicester Not being called a cunt by fans he gave his all for
<HS> I’ll never forgive you <CN> Wdym if he joins now he’ll be the captain when they lift the ucl in 5 years
<HS> The number of people sticking up for is totally sick!! Vile scum like that shouldn't be released for VERY long time!! #masongreenwood <CN> I disagree. I think Man Utd should release him immediately. If found guilty he should not play again.
<HS> West Ham player filmed violently kicking his cat. Doesn’t he understand difference between a simple animal and a football? Horrible man should be prosecuted <CN> Right well now the hatred seeps through. A defenceless animal is a step too far. Zouma needs putting down
<HS> I hope you are watching this is how to finish you bozo <CN> No hermano I beg for 120K a week for doing nothing!
<HS> Mikel Arteta is such a vindictive twat who should never have managed Arsenal Football Club. What a horrible human being. I stand with . <CN> Auba can leave Arsenal man,...i dont care what player you are, you cant be underperforming and still have disciplinary issues everytime...rules are rules.
<HS> Hey You are a damn psychopath. Who does this kind of thing anyway? Seek help. 🙄 <CN> Did that kid hold up the cat for him to smack? If so, this is definitely not the "one off" he claims it to be. Which is still one way too many. 😾😾😾
<HS> Those two poor cats are most likely terrified of Kurt Zouma & his entire family. When you ‘love and cherish’ something, you don’t do that to it. The way the kid held it up and didn’t even flinch when it was slapped makes me think it’s not an isolated incident. Fuck you <CN> Maisie says keep the dirty filthy beast away from her. Hope he never gets to kick a football let alone a animal ever again.
<HS> LOOOOOOOL you’re just a shit Ramsdale <CN> What is he complaining about? Lol Such whiners
<HS> I hope sack your arse off Absolutely disgusting behaviour <CN> Truly disgusting. Needs locking up.
<HS> Kevin you dog!! <CN> Fu and f city
<HS> Fuck off man, If u had giving that pass we would have beaten Watford <CN> Hey relax 😂
<HS> The support by the is rather quiet. The most noise I heard out of them was in dismay at their own players or to boo at (who is a cunt) and walking out with 15 minutes still to go is just disrespectful. <CN> Why is he a cunt for? 🤔
<HS> Portuguese rat looking twat <CN> Wtf?
<HS> First class knobhead! <CN> You're the first class fool
<HS> Do us all a favour and fcuk off <CN> Clarity, don't play shit when you get your chance and you'll get more minutes.
<HS> Exactly this Sarah! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 #AnimalAbuse #scumbag #CatsOfTwitter #dogsoftwitter <CN> Absolutely!!
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> Absolutely #KurtZouma you are an absolute piece of shit.
<HS> Get out of my team dont wanna see you tomorrow <CN> Probably never been a game in your life
<HS> fuck off u prick think of the fans for once <CN> So he isn’t allowed to be cold?
<HS> Come on, what do you think you are doing on the pitch? Are you a soccer player or a model like Kai the idiot <CN> Surprise surprise name+numbers being a prick on a faceless account
<HS> this piece of scum purports to be a #lufc fan. Identify & ban. Hatred towards our players should NEVER be tolerated. This is not banter or a football opinion it’s hatred and discrimination [BODY] <CN> [BODY] Bunch of Haters ! Enjoy the win and support always our Club and all our lads 💙💛🤍
<HS> It’s no surprise someone with this mentality would feel threatened by the arrival of Ronaldo. If you’re complaining about the demands BEFORE Ronaldo, you’ll never survive alongside him. Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <CN> The guy is a fraud and we call him our captain. Seriously, he’s clearly not fit to lead any premiership team let alone M.U.F.C
<HS> Just go away, ain’t nobody worried about your useless apology letter every week. <CN> We’re all upset but there’s no need to get nasty about it. Maguire’s not been playing well at all but he’s clearly just trying to speak to the fans. Even with everyone wanting ole out, that’s fine and I agree but let’s not get nasty about it, he’s still a club legend.
<HS> 1 So my 11 year old son has quit his football team this week as a couple of team mates have told him he's he's terrible player! U get some reet horrible little twats! His confidence is down! He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> Where are you based. I run a men’s football team when the weather and light night resume bring him along to our training and the lads will have a kick about with your son. I take my step son to every game and training and he joins in and he’s the same age as your boy. Dm me
<HS> Not only are you a proper shit footballer . Your an absolute bottle job , every fucking tackle every fucking header , jog around like a complete tosser doing fuck all ! How your still a spurs player is beyond me <CN> How can you this respect your own players disgusting 🤦🏻‍♂️
<HS> Didn’t think Mount was a money whore… looks as he’s leaving. Prick. <CN> wait what?
<HS> rather be dead than be a mag <CN> All you got to do now is go to St James park and be caught holding hands with a bloke by the owners and they’ll sort that for you mate
<HS> I hate you <CN> We hate you more
<HS> If you commented under post last night because you didn't like what he tweeted, then you ain't Chelsea and you're a sad sad little mug who needs to grow up and take a long hard look at yourself. <CN> 100% in agreement with you mate👍
<HS> Hey , next time I see u taking a penalty kick knowing CR7 is in the field, I’m whooping ur silly ass. Do not ever try that shit again! <CN> Its so disrespectful to take CR7 off penalty duties💔
<HS> You are a disgrace. <CN> Hi Users!! Listen !! Listen!! Listen!! Bitcoin AxeRing is a Bitcoin Cloud Mining app which made for user to mine bitcoins in your android device and earn UpTo $50 min bitcoins in your BTC wallet and earn as daily basis.
<HS> You and Ronaldo are fucking criminals <CN> Unfortunately hold dat
<HS> what a miraculous recovery...on the left when u dont want to to play against city and a week later everythings fine and play against crappy Spurs u aint a G.O.A.T Ronaldo your a F.R.A.U.D. <CN> Like how ur goat has 2 league goals 😂
<HS> Never grow that f*cking pony tail back ever again <CN> it was the bad luck charm clearly
<HS> I am disappointed in you. The sooner you leave my club the better. I work hard all year to buy match ticket, Jersey for myself and family so the club can pay your outrageous salary but you refuse to play. No more Martial FC, fvk*g get out of my club you mercenary <CN> Didn’t you see his post ?
<HS> Why are u cuck u Turkish rat <CN> hes actually spittin
<HS> Stop with the PR, You're shite, worst signing & captain in history of football <CN> Chill, this is him as a person and nothing to do with him being a footballer. Is he currently the biggest liability on the team, yeah. But this was a lovely thing he did as a person. I praise anyone that wants to help kids in need
<HS> You are a DISGUSTING excuse for a human being ! Anyone who abuses animals says VOLUMES about who they really are!! Your brother video taping? Black lives matter and SO DO ANIMALS!!! You are only sorry you got caught! SHAME ON YOU!😠 #animalslivesmatter #RSPCA #KARMA 😤 <CN> Your comments are nothing but a bunch of insanity. Really??? This is the animal not human being. Zouma didn't attack a human being, he attacked an animal. What exactly is wrong with you. Who cares about the cat. Where I'm coming from we care about human beings a lot not animals.
<HS> Shit off the field as well as on it not good enough to wear the shirt embarrassing <CN> Mate I'm not even a Liverpool fan but I'm embarrassed from reading such a dumb tweet 😭
<HS> Its so sad to see throwing his career away before it has barely begun What an idiot, keep it in your pants man! <CN> Who cares about his career? Think about the girl who has been raped and abused
<HS> Players who go down holding there face when the camera shows them not even getting touched in the face need booked. Cheating is cheating <CN> Salah would be the most booked player in prem history if that was the case
<HS> its 2022 and no major soccer player owns any good NFTs... they are letting us down so bad. buy some NFTs you fucks!! <CN> Sergi Roberto got some captain america nft on veve
<HS> Fergie and me must tump you in yuh face if you ever decide to go City so play mad.. <CN> Robinho - man City - rape. B. Mendy - man city - rape. Adam Johnson - man city - rape. Ched Evans - man city - rape. Ronaldo fits perfect🤮
<HS> How the fuck can start ?! Honestly a complete and utter disgrace <CN> They’ve certainly put the cat 🐈‍⬛ amongst the pigeons playing him 🙈
<HS> you’re shit, you’ve got a wank trim and you eat snails nerd <CN> Man said
<HS> Are you totally thick?We know you people who kick balls, earning abhorrent salaries are not known for brains,but what has Zouma abusing a cat got to do with racism? Stop the race card.Zouma abusing an animal with sentient feelings is not acceptable. He will be prosecuted, rightly <CN> He’s been punished enough, he doesn’t deserve to be sacked
<HS> How about some G/A mf? <CN> Lmao, you must be delusional.. mount even in his worst games can still boast of top 2 highest g/A in the team in the last 2 years
<HS> These are the type of players that we want out of the club immediately.. You're a disgrace <CN> Think of most of this squad we’re binned off tomorrow no one would bat an eyelid
<HS> Shit club <CN> ratioed by europeon champions
<HS> You’re still a rapist. This hasn’t changed. <CN> Why are you here then?? Stupid idiot golddigger fan of fraud Kathryn Mayorga??
<HS> FUCK OFF <CN> Sub him now
<HS> you belong in a dark room no windows no lights just you and your rapist self fucking disgusting you how the fuck do you sleep at night knowing your a rapist your mum and dad should be ashamed to call you their son kiss goodbye to your career😂 <CN> So will your child mr judge
<HS> Have that you little rat <CN> Nothing better than seeing that little French rat crying.
<HS> Decent player is but such a fanny. Touched on the arm wants a penalty <CN> If it’s not a penalty he should be booked for diving.. pathetic
<HS> you need to cease your partnership with vile animal abuser forthwith! <CN> sign the petition to get him prosecuted
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> They should throw a bottle of piss next time 🤣
<HS> First class knobhead! <CN> You’re the one whose exposing they’re true colour here, Antonio made it quite clear that he did not at all condone what Zouma did so I can’t see how he’s a knobhead for wanting to bring attention to how incidents of racism are reacted to in comparison to the reaction to this
<HS> This cunt should be put in the lion enclosure at the zoo <CN> He’s a brave man isn’t he 🤬🤬
<HS> I know you’re sick <CN> Just sad, he needs this move
<HS> Rum and dry ginger bastard ….. no you fuck off and take with you #mufc <CN> You not got a proper glass to put that puff drink in?
<HS> Have some shame🤡🤡 <CN> Fewer titles than Everton, have some shame😭🤣
<HS> if that video is really you kicking the cat, you're actually scum. better issue severe punishment. Hope looking into it too. Disgusting <CN> The people demand that the RSPCA take action and have Zouma arrested!
<HS> You should also step aside, fraud. <CN> Suffering continues 😂
<HS> You're shit <CN> L from u
<HS> you are starting to let my club down too mf pick it up or go fuck off <CN> Stfu. Its fans like you that ruin the image of our club. AFTV energy.
<HS> absolute waste of sperm 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 <CN> Sigh, never expected dis
<HS> What bugs me is what kind of a captain is suppose to be if he is letting bench players spill stuff to the media and undermine the manager? A fucking weasel thats what #utfr 🇾🇪 <CN> Thinking of ye bud. Head up ❤️
<HS> Never thought I’d agree with opposition fans but last night, Leeds fans were spot on. Tyrone Mings is fucking shit. <CN> When I heard it, I thought of you right away 😂😂
<HS> He’s shite pal <CN> Ratio then
<HS> shameless <CN> Bruh it’s like this guy is tryna get revenge for us putting him on the bench for so long
<HS> There was no way on earth that was offside , we was robbed , who ever is operating var should call himself dick Turpin <CN> Just call himself Dick head would do.

<HS> No one I hate more then <CN> He doesn’t like you either mate
<HS> MASON GREENWORD IS A VILE HUMAN BEING AND DESERVES ALL THE ABUSE HE SUFFERS ONLINE MOVING FORWARD. IF ANY[BODY] DEFENDS HIM THEN THEY'RE A RAPIST TOO!!!!! <CN> Innocent until proven guilty,not my rules

Won't ever pass to him, even if it means he won't start anymore. <CN> P.S. That ball against Atalanta wasn't an assist, but simply a bad control.. Stick to football or F*ck off already
<HS> Yeah, right. Fuck you <CN> No. Those cats should be taken away from them. If this is how he treats them then what has he taught his children. No. Absolutely not.

Highlight of my week watching my boy play at weekends. 👍
<HS> 😂😂 top shithouse <CN> Forgive, I am confused because I thought this goal was offside. However, is it possible VAR gave the goal because the ball was played on to Hjelde?
<HS> Good on that lass outing for the horrible piece of shit that he is. No female should ever be treated or made to feel like that. Put him in jail. <CN> Actually turned my stomach and the scary thing is it happens so often 😣
<HS> As a Manchester United fan I will be disgusted if ever plays for us again. Show him the door #MUFC <CN> As a man Glenn you should be disgusted not because your a utd fan

<HS> Mason Greenwood waving goodbye to his career. Will never play Premier League or International football again. Read those words shithead . <CN> Idk The unfortunate truth about green wood career is that if he's half as talented as they claim him to be he will find his way back into football. The only question is If it's with Manchester United. Apparently their was a legal case prior but he still played so you never know
<HS> Please don't look at this if you're upset by the abuse of cats and other animals. Prosecution and jail for this scum. <CN> So why the fuck do you have pets you Cretinous cunt!!

<HS> [BODY] Pls leave Man Utd.. u r the worst and a disgrace captain in Man Utd history.. <CN> [BODY] You’re really going into the history book, and you’ll carve history for Man United dude, when we finish bottom 10 and relegated.

<HS> Animal cruelty is not ‘an accident’ or mistake. It’s an intentional action to cause harm or distress to a living creature. It cannot be compared to drink driving, what a stupid thing to say. you are a disgrace for playing <CN> So drunk driving is an accident? 🤡
<HS> Rivalry between players is non existent, back in the day Kane would have tweeted fuck off you traitor <CN> Hardly like he’s joining Spurs’ rivals tho is it
<HS> Nothing infuriates me more than cruelty to innocent animals. you are a vile human being. <CN> If I ever see a Villa player doing something similar to that and the club lets that person play another game I am out. #avfc
<HS> this comment section is why I dislike religion. people get hate for choosing how they want to live, just because someone has decided that it's "unholy". I'll respect you for choosing to believe whatever, but when you try to force others to follow your lifestyle you can fuck off. <CN> whose forcing🤔
<HS> Shame on you Greenwood, please out from Manchester United <CN> I need the lottery numbers ASAP. It seems like you are living in the future mate.

<HS> This man is Graeme Souness. A failed manager. He is Scottish and ex Liverpool; he has just suggested that should not play football ever again this season. This is now spiralling out control. Souness is a just a bloody racist hidden in a cat’s skin. <CN> cry fight racism or stay quiet you never doing anything against racism bc you have no balls for fight :)
<HS> [BODY] Leave my club.... your evil is enough...😖😖😖 <CN> [BODY] Leave earth, your existence is enough
<HS> What a vile disgusting piece of shit you are Let’s hope your employers are equally as outraged! <CN> What a disgusting individual .make a stand WHUFC .the family vlub .let's see you get rid of this filth
<HS> Your poison. Don’t deserve to be in your position. Draining the club with your greed. Enough is enough. Just leave. The fans don’t want to see you in a Utd shirt again. <CN> Sure he wanted to leave did he not?😂
<HS> Just look at repeatedly being caught out of position. 80m GBP for this absolute waste of space that has zero positional awareness. Was the reason for the Atleti goal as well. #MUFC want to call our fans trolls again for him being rubbish? <CN> Homely the day that pussio leaves the club am gonna celebrate like we won the ucl
<HS> I just hate the way they treated . <CN> Me... after the decision by discipline committee or competitions committee regarding the vs bus, on & out pitch incident.
<HS> Fuck off with him Hope this helps <CN> Respect our players man, you are such a loser behind tweeter disrespecting our players

<HS> ⁦ when are you prosecuting this vile thug ? ⁦⁩ are cowardly complicit animal abuse enablers Sick Zouma copycat craze: Thugs film themselves kicking felines in horrific imitation of footballer | Daily Mail <CN> Unless I missed something has he even gone to that so called animal awareness course and has got that promised donation yet ? Last I heard hadn't contacted... if they had then matter is closed for Zuma
<HS> Embarrassing. <CN> Losing 4-1 to Watford is embarrassing. Trent livng rent free? 😂
<HS> You gonna write another apology on Twitter? For the 67th time this season, you fucking boring cunt, garbage. <CN> Always said he’s shite, Tark is miles better than that block head at centre back and does not deserve to wear that captains arm band! Ole’s at the wheel 😎
<HS> Right I’m off to sleep! Goodnight all oh and is a massive cunt 👍☺️ <CN> I just physically laughed at that 😂
<HS> [BODY] Wasn’t rly riddled with injuries but okay, put it this way if Steffen didn’t have the best game of his life in that league cup semi then we wouldn’t be here saying Bruno ghosted. Was our best players versus Sevilla aswel you gimp, tell me you didn’t watch the game. <CN> [BODY] You either didn't watch the game vs City or you watched it with your United-tinted glasses. He was appalling in that game just like how he was appalling against Chelsea in the FA cup semi. He ghosted in the final against Villareal to further prove my point.
<HS> how you're a professional footballer is beyond me, fuck off with rafa you bag of shite <CN> Turn it in you clown
<HS> Fuck youuuuuuuu <CN> Hate him
<HS> This is actually disgusting. Yes, it’s a huge trigger warning and you might not like listening to it but she has every right to post it and he’s clearly done it before, which is why she’s recorded him. you disgusting, vile twat. <CN> She is so brave to have risked taking recordings and photos because if he was battering her before, god knows what he’d have done if he’d found them, and it’s safe to assume someone capable of that wouldn’t think twice before checking her phone etc.
<HS> Ur fat <CN> Still better than Pack Prealish
<HS> Hope you enjoyed that game you twat <CN> It's not advisable to call someone that. Be professional.
<HS> We hate you as you hate our king MO salah <CN> No
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> Seems west ham were lying when they said we are ashamed etc
<HS> Go away pal <CN> Why do you De Gea FC hate competition so much man, it’s so cringe 🤣🤣
<HS> off ya pop! off ya pop! off ya pop! off ya pop! off ya pop! off ya pop! off ya pop! ADAM REACH off ya pop! Kyle Bartley off ya pop! Nowt personal but yam shit and can’t be arsed tarrah👋 <CN> I’m afraid Castro has to go on that list as well , he looks way out of his depth at this level

<HS> Video of kicking and slapping his cat while another sadistic person laughs while filming. Why is this twisted and malicious person still playing for his team West Ham? <CN> That’s just SO sick. I can’t even put it into words.
<HS> And the cheeky prick is “considering his future and not happy not in the starting 11” get to fuck Up there with the worst performance I’ve ever seen and the worst refereeing performance I’ve ever seen <CN> My goodness! You bitterly hate this guys. They all have been a big it personal?
<HS> fuck off back to Westham please. <CN> why don't you go join him please. :)
<HS> Nothing infuriates me more than cruelty to innocent animals. you are a vile human being. <CN> Exactly Dan hope something gets done
<HS> Go rot in prison lol <CN> Big news for both clubs today
<HS> You are shite <CN> What’s up with you
<HS> Good for speaking out But just accept the fact that you never qualified to play for this club You have no ball control You have no defending abilities Your positioning sucks You don’t read games You don’t show a great character to players around you You just sh!t Mag 😪 <CN> No leader qualities .. I don’t know why he wears the armband
<HS> Fuck you . Making it closer ffs <CN> He’s your goat 😳
<HS> I want to see mason greenwood pull himself out of this, you probably put the cunt over your career and you're a fucking idiot for doin that, you wear a jersey, but you're probably too young to understand what that means to the global fans. <CN> He shouldve pulled out a lot of things...
<HS> Disgrace of human being. Way to be an awful parent on top of an animal abuser. Sick fuck. <CN> Fr that video was so horrible to watch
<HS> + = Disgusting Karen Brady if you stay silent you should be ashamed of yourself - more concerned on the starting XI than the ethics of the club. What message does it send? You can beat animals and get away with it if you are good enough at football? #ForShame <CN> Exactly. Karen Brady has gone down in my estimation. That won't worry her, but shows that money rules. I thought she had ethics though, obviously hard headed business does not care about animals and Zouma knows that
<HS> It’s an absolute disgrace but sort of sums up the new era of football. All about money and they’ll use something like ‘we need to stand by our man, it’s up to the authorities to do their job, not us’. Shame on shame on shame on You’re all scum <CN> Reckon if someone hoofs him n then says "sorry ref I thought he was a cat" they'll get away with it? Once each?
<HS> Really don’t what’s worse? playing yesterday or the videos of him abusing an animal. Classless to have him play after the video was shown. What a piece of crap. Take him to the zoo and have him kick a Lion now. That will surely change his mind about it. 🤬🤬 <CN> 100%
<HS> you're so useless now <CN> Enough of the abuse
<HS> This is why I hate this guy! Just a 36 year old salty ass without any sportsmanship. Shameless Pendu 🤡 <CN> He doesn’t know you exist so hate hom or love him,he feels it not😂😂
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> He can't help it! dragged out of the gutter, and all because he can play a bit of football! A waste of good black skin!! 😡
<HS> You disgust me - you are the lowest of the low and should face charges for what you have done. Horrific animal abuse. Complete scumbag <CN> I’m actually disgusted at this. Cruel cruel scumbag. Prick 🤬
<HS> Reply bozo you ain't drake <CN> Hi 👋
<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> Or just put it in the bin rather than attention seeking.....
<HS> How!!!!!🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡 I don’t want to see you on the field again 😡😡😡 <CN> So you didn't see where the problem came from but you want to crucify the De Gea because you're fcukin blind to admit that he single handedly saved Man utd from Liverpool embarrassment, keep hating
<HS> Piece of shit. I hope you get locked up forever. <CN> Why "get locked up forever"? He didn't kill anybody.
<HS> I absolutely HATE Everton as a club and playing for them makes it even sweeter. Utter arseholes of a club and deserve to go down #nufc #EFC <CN> Just as well Lampard has sorted them out after 1 game

Fuck you I hope your cats have been taken off you and has taken action. May you never play football again 🖕🏼 <CN> I don’t know who he is or what he did but looking at his social media, it’s clear he is in love with himself.

Funny how have managed to do the right thing with regard to his brother.
<HS> If don’t sack immediately they’re complicit in this. Disgusting man. <CN> They put him in a dressing room with Ronaldo. They are already complicit.
<HS> Fvck you You're a rat 😡😡😡 <CN> What happen?
<HS> are COMPLETE ARSEHOLES as they will not let my son buy more than 8 books that he wishes to donate to kids here in Grenada. I spend £000s with Amazon. Merry Christmas you Scrooge-type a’holes! <CN> You truly awful people. All that money you make, taxes you don’t pay and you treat customers like shit????? Bastards!
<HS> Get yourself out of Manchester United , you’re not bigger than the club, if you can’t admit that you have been trash for 2 years without improving, then you must be delusional, OLE pampered you, we all saw it. You silly ass epistles can’t save you anymore. <CN> Broo. Chill.

<HS> I don't know and I now definitely don't WANT to know him. To treat an animal like that and still be allowed to play professionally is reprehensible. He should be fired, fined and possibly jailed, let alone allowed to play football. Fuck you #KurtZouma <CN> 💯. Reprehensible!
<HS> you're a real p.o.s , what you did to that cat was discusting <CN> Sick, sick man. Mentally sick. Vile. Disgusting. Why keep pets if you don't love them? I am sure he must be abusing the humans around him too. It is a sickness

<HS> you fucking idiot go home your not good enough 👊😡😡 <CN> Are you completely fucking stupid ? You are slagging off a Leeds player that's given his all for the club. We need him more than we need terminally stupid cunts like you. Now fuck off !
<HS> & Moyes, you’re all absolutely disgusting. 🤢🤮 <CN> If you show your fellow humans the kind of love you showing a cat, then you would understand that #zouma made a mistake and he is sorry. Allow the lad to get back on track in peace and face his livelihood and passion. Is 250k fine not enough

No man should ever act like that EVER, he needs to be stripped of the shirt and dealt with by the police. I cannot condone that

As a manager he is giving us a real roller coaster ride but I still support him...but I'm wondering what kind of man he is because his treatment of some players is questionable

<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment.

The British principle (in law) has always been, everyone, is innocent, until (if) proven guilty, by their peers. I wish some people in Social Media, would remember that.
<HS> Fuck off <CN> Chucking things at players is just wrong but he went down there like he’d been hit with a rock...pretty pathetic as it was nowhere near his head #dickhead

West Ham ace Kurt Zouma filmed KICKING and slapping his pet cat <CN> I'm with you - What he did was beyond cruel. Take that cat away from him, ban him from keeping any animal and get him off the football team. Also make him pay for any treatment the cat needs.
<HS> Simple really you are an animal abuser or you are not, you get something from causing suffering to a vulnerable living being that cannot defend itself or you don’t and ‘apologies’ and ‘condemnation’ won’t stop this ‘ <CN> I'm really disappointed with Zouma's behaviour. That was very disturbing.
<HS> You should be sacked, and never be allowed to keep animals ever again you utter filth. An apology is unacceptable. <CN> He did more than kick it across the floor. He hit it repeatedly while it was being held for him to do so. Sickening
<HS> Are you a fraud? 🤔 You have zero goals zero assists this season 🤔🤔 <CN> Didn't he get an assist today
<HS> Fucking cheat. <CN> How much did he pay the officials? That's the end of F1.
<HS> Do u play football you dinner lady <CN> leave the house
<HS> Fuck off Dele MF 😭😭😭😭 washed mf <CN> Wtf. Did he score?
<HS> get back to playing or are you worried you can't get in team haaaa enjoy your self isolation.............lazy arse COYB <CN> A very poor one at that. Vamos James Rodriguez. Everton's Columbian Magician. El Jugador magnifico esta Goodison Park. 13/09/21. Doesn't have to isolate returning from Spain. Know your facts before posting. UTFT. JAMES RODRIGUEZ EL CRAC.
<HS> You're a cheat just like the rest of your team. Feigning injury, diving, play acting. Have you got no shame? Perhaps you're proud to be a blantent cheat. Wolves couldn't cope with Leeds so broke the game up by inventing injuries & ref was weak enough to let you get away with it. <CN> Just wait till u play Brentford you’ll soon be saying it to them the game was meant to be 90 mins wen we played then the ball was in play for 50 minutes out the 90
<HS> Rapist <CN> The document about Cristiano Ronaldo. "she said no" is fabricated. Kathryn fraud Mayorga was never raped. She didn't tell the Police his name or where it happened.
<HS> What the fuck was that ? You should be fucking ashamed <CN> Don’t buy they both went down for nothing. There was a bunch of stuff on the pitch that could have been what hit them.
<HS> F i n i s h e d <CN> Okay but clear of that fraud you rep🤡
<HS> Tell FSG to get their fingers out their arse and fucking do something <CN> anyway, fuckin batter these lot #YNWA

<HS> Thank goodness I wasn’t the only one who noticed this. Maguire’s out of position to begin with, get a grip bitch <CN> Nothing new. is a fucking fraud. Biggest heist of 80m.
<HS> Tell Rafa he’s a knobhead, mate. <CN> He defo won’t be taken to next game then tho he has to think about that
<HS> Muppet <CN> Lad that’s grim tha🥴
<HS> That frigging cheat was already on his way diving. <CN> Soon social distancing will be part of the game.
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> Very stupid and highly foolish comment….SMH
<HS> Really hope gets violated every second his in prison, the dirty scummy rapist cunt 🖕🏼 <CN> Ps follow back

<HS> . how about a forward pass bozo 🤡🤡🤡 <CN> Van de cheeks tryna make a forward pass
<HS> Don't you dare say we'll come back stronger . Your all an embarrassment. Hang ya heads in shame. Disgracing our great club . It's you who should be sacked <CN> always bring on their A game on the pitch of play. Those annoying statements is always being tendered by those whose commitments could be questioned like
<HS> I used to think signing Bebe & Obertan was the worst signing ever but big head, slab head, freezer head, double decker bus head is the worst of them all..😭😭😭😭 <CN> Obertan 😭😭😭,where that one even Dey now sef
<HS> Fuck offfff <CN> Why r u leading such a blind campaign against someone who's only flaw is the weakness in his machete, he through no fault of our own never played consecutive games for us so he could show his true colors ,ofc the best solution is sending him on loan to other foreign club n yell
<HS> If you like fvck up. <CN> Fuck this ratio up
<HS> Dead to me ft. <CN> lol
<HS> 1 So my 11 year old son has quit his football team this week as a couple of team mates have told him he's he's terrible player! U get some reet horrible little twats! His confidence is down! He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> I played for teams where I was the only one scoring and creating goals and the idiots would take me off all the time and give me the last 20 mins of games they were losing. People are dumb and stupid. Keep giving your best and you'll get noticed in time.
<HS> You’re shit <CN> Benderson holding bench inject

<HS> We need a proper structure and new owners as well. F*ck off Glazers and f*ck off Have me excused for my choice of words <CN> What’s wrong with Ronaldo?
<HS> Honestly has gotta leave. This clueless #OleOut still plays rubbish like and #Fred who keeps fucking up. A blind man will also know these 2 garbage gotta go.. #SackOle #MaguireOut <CN> I thought De gea played well enough, it's just our defence...it's so bad. Had it not been for De Gea, we would have suffered from an even worse loss.
<HS> Bruno clear you clown <CN> Who?
<HS> Ratio bozo My trust wallet has been hacked I would pay anyone to write essay I lost Bitcoin My Instagram has been hacked and banned Metamask has been hacked <CN> I fixed all the issues I had with Metamask using this help center. Use the link below, very fast and reliable.

He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> Messi was told he wasn’t good enough by one team when he was very young look at how that turned out 😂. Hope he finds a new team and turns his old one inside out if he gets the chance
<HS> rat <CN> Cry more
<HS> If this is true then Greenwood’s contract should be terminated and released from the club. I could never celebrate or support an abuser. I feel for his girlfriend, I hope she is able to heal after this. Really hope this isn’t true but I’m fucking disgusted in . 😔 <CN> If true I can't even look back at the memories of Ole fondly. Greenwood potentially not only ruined himself but is going to destroy united academy and culture. This is soo bad.
<HS> You're a disgrace to Nigeria. You cannot play for your original country but you can accept to play in another man's land, England. We are disappointed <CN> Ratioooooo
<HS> 2009 till date yet to be proven guilty 😭😭😭 and he’s a rapist keep going 💀💀💀🤡🤡🤡 <CN> Clearly don’t know how bribery works do you
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> U sound like a Crystal Palace or Alstonvilla fan I understand your pain. Blue is always Blues brother.
<HS> Someone just sent me the full video. Disgusting. Hope you lose everything & are prosecuted. Hope that poor cat is with decent humans now. Bollocks to you too if you’re playing him tonight. Bollocks to football for now in fact if this is the case. <CN> He deserves to rot! I hope West Ham sack him immediately
<HS> Never thought would say this but you are a evil wan*er <CN> What about the fucker filming it… disgusting laughing away
<HS> #Loser_Ronaldo #CristianoRonaldo You are most selfish player who can not Stand the success of Leo Messi! You call yourself a professional player? You are not even a Human Being! You should have shame for signing a shit <CN> Cry about it
<HS> you can suck a fat one you cunt <CN> Tired con?😂
<HS> Hey I will sit on your face of you score a brace🥺 <CN> Is this something Diogo wants ? 😂 barely gains us rank anyway
<HS> And this my fellow humans is a prime example of the utterly vile people that we are inflicted with in a daily basis. I would hope that someone kicks the living 💩 out of this excuse of a human being. you are a disgrace to humanity. <CN> The only reason he apologised was because he got caught. How many times has he done this in the past
<HS> fuck off out of our club. You are a Sunday league player at best. Break a leg out there today mate <CN> Dude, what the fuck

<HS> This is a horrendous statement from her father!! needs locking up and a lifetime ban from football! Couldn’t give a fuck how talented he is, nothing gives you the right to treat anyone like that! <CN> won't get a lifetime ban (unfortunately) there's players who've killed drunk driving etc and still a team took them on once their prison time is done. sad but true. i hope he never plays again and karma visits
<HS> Fair play anyone saying his mum deserved it because she threw first needs to give their head a wobble. Blokes shouldn't hit women, EVER. If you think it's OK to hit a women you were raised by a complete twat. #foden <CN> No but she's a dopey cow for going starting something she could have easily avoided, she could have got everyone on her side seriously hurt. Clearly can't defend herself but instigates the violence There's gonna be people saying things if fodens your son. Rise above it. Common AF
<HS> This is abuse of the highest degree. Disgusting man. needs to be prosecuted and sacked by <CN> Yet the only say they’ll take action IF NECESSARY. OUTRAGEOUS!!

You big nosed twat... #gonzo #nosejob you may think twice before you try to incite the crowd good job it was only little Cambridge and not a big club who would of chased you and you're big snout and fat cunt of a manager out of town <CN> Bet you poke lego up your bum James, go back to the ground and ask for your 20p back you threw at our keeper , you can get your energy drink for school tomorrow that way
<HS> You're a "brave" man for kicking your cat. Disgusting piece of sh*t. <CN> Be interested to see how this thread develops. Already a good proportion of female animal lovers over male, demonstrating their more empathetic natures. God knows what happens when they discovers Marcus Rashford eats human babies
<HS> Your a crybaby didn't want you anyways <CN> A useless b !!! Always said it.
<HS> [BODY] shove ur gopro up ur arse u knob <CN> [BODY] I love Ben Foster 😭
<HS> What a nasty little shite is. Here is hope prosecutes and sacks him. #AnimalCruelty <CN> He probably can’t win from something his own size, so picks on the smaller and weaker beings. Sad git, and the same goes for the low life that video’s it.
<HS> Leave the country pls don't ever come back <CN> Lmao but this is home country tho😭
<HS> Complete bollocks….why is he taking about racism? The question was in relation to his team mate volleying his cat…… you daft bastard ! <CN> To be fair, this was the cat in question.
<HS> being a typical aggressive tw*t. Now he wants to play the big man….. shut up and sit down…. You sound stupid! <CN> And he look like a sissy
<HS> Complete bollocks….why is he taking about racism? The question was in relation to his team mate volleying his cat…… you daft bastard ! <CN> And if this doesn’t show how out of touch some footballers are with the real world I don’t know what does
<HS> Good one you piece of shit 👏🏻👏🏻 <CN> She ain’t gonna shag u 😹
<HS> Leeds fans- "Tyrone mings is fucking shit" *Aston villa wins 3-0* - <CN> Lovely, lovely stuff.
<HS> see instead of caring about kids.. hows about doing ur fucking job that lead u to feeding them fucking kids... paid 100s of thousands of pounds each week to do fuck all on a football pitch u should be ashamed to wear the united shirt fucking pathetic <CN> What’s more important. A ball or kids? Grow up. United were shite even before he came on
<HS> Do u know what I think, I think Mo Salah‘s agent is a fucking prick, who only has his own personal gain at the forefront of his mind, I also think if Mo was going to sign a new contract, he would’ve done it by now… #TheGrassIsntAlwaysGreener think about this #ynwa <CN> Can’t he think for himself then young lady.
<HS> Useless cunt <CN> Please go Harry, please...if you love the club ...please go....seriously...the worst CH in a Utd jersey in 45 years supporting them. Pls go..please

<HS> That post is just so unprofessional, imagine if Everton pull their deal after watching this kinda behaviour from him. Do you think he will have any sort of career left? Absolutely disgraceful man <CN> Arsenal rejected the deal,he has every right to voice his discontent,what’s the point of rejecting and keeping him hostage at the club if you’re not going to play him?
<HS> Got to love fans turning on a 20 year old lad and blaming your sh*t season on him. #Pathetic would struggle in your Team you Morons. Call him back as this will do more harm than good mentally to 💙 #CFC <CN> Billy Gilmore will be an amazing player and already is with the right coach behind him.
<HS> Damn right here here 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 wanker <CN> Black Privilege. Nobody will say it
<HS> Just a shit Declan Rice <CN> Like Bowen is a shit raphinha then

<HS> What boils my piss the most is the likes of etc who are so self absorbed the shirt means nothing. Give me Phil Jones over them cry babies any day. Get rid of the fucking lot and start again and get rid of the pricks that run the Twitter as well <CN> Not sure you should be going after Sancho but Lingard, Martial and Ronaldo all deserve it
<HS> Hey you gonna sack that spineless shit for abusing an animal? And doing so in front of a child? 🤔 #Sack #Scumbag <CN> Damn right buddy.

<HS> What a hype bastard you are Andrew. 8 years you kept silence while Ukrainian military was killing civilians in Donbass. And now you waked up? You not just only a worse high salary player we've ever signed but even a worse like a person. Hope will never see you in Iron shirt again <CN> Shut up you dickhead. Your country is killing and invading Ukraine, looking to start a war, and you attack Ukraine. Don’t be a prick and shut up
<HS> hope you’re letting this animal abusing thug scumbag know exactly what you think of him tonight <CN> Who?
<HS> Fuck off Mason Greenwood absolute piece of shit fuck you absolute wanker <CN> ur hard
<HS> Think it’s poor some fans startin to turn on mind, been a rare speckle of glitter in an absolute pile of dog shit. Could drop Messi in this squad and he’d still look average at times. Clubs on its arse from 14 years of Ashley nowt else, don’t forget that. #NUFC <CN> He has but the last 3 games he’s been a shadow of his earlier season self. Whereas before he was making good decisions, now he’s just running into trouble and losing the ball.
<HS> I hate you both so much just leave my club <CN> better leave now lads
<HS> Last man standing 😢, need to stunt on deez hoes <CN> Your thoughts on Midson Mount getting into BdO top 30 sir?

I cant even begin to think about what she has gone through. <CN> The bible says judge not so you not be judged,,,why drawing conclusions when All that was just a roleplay
<HS> Good! Cats feel pain and feel scared! 😡😡😡 <CN> Good I spoke about him on talk radio the other week. This is overdue
<HS> No way this kid is shit. No Arsenal crap is plenty. Waste of space pile of shit player. 150K a week to do tik tok videos and give the ball away. Literally Arsenal can just fck off. And take useless oxlade <CN> calm down fella😂
<HS> Chat shit, get banged <CN> It's really sad. I used to respect him so much for the way he showed up for the club.
<HS> Goat dickhead <CN> Imagine abusing your academy player on his personal opinion🤡.
<HS> your fault, you fuckin snake <CN> How is he a snake? He didn’t request to leave or state an intent to leave. The club accepted the bid to sell their biggest asset so blame your board not a player that has moved to actually win a deserved trophy in his career.

That's never happened ever in the history of the judicial system mate, and it aint gonna happen for a rich exfootballer
<HS> Sancho is better than you, fraud. <CN> Havertz is better than this ratio.
<HS> [BODY] Once again, Drogba’s a striker you clown, Frank Lampard had a 20 year career and your slandering Bruno because he hasn’t done it in 1.5 seasons 🤣🤣🤣🤣 <CN> [BODY] Learn to understand English you clown, I said "impact". Go see the number of chances Drobga got in that defensively-set up Chelsea vs the number of chances Bruno gets every game. Lampard stepped up in Bruno's age in the big games. Work on your reading comprehension.

<HS> This message it's for idiots. How fuckt you heave to be. I don't care abaut any sport because i can rich any performance. But to write a message of heate just because you love somebody else you ar fuckt. <CN> You heave to love Judah because without him the story of Jesus's was just a cartoon on a rock. So when you dont heave an enemy at the same level with you or better then you, you dont know your real value. So you heave to love them equally.
<HS> Shut up You've done nothing these last two years but steal Money <CN> ??😭

Look at me".

<HS> Wow. all that talent and he’s now even more of a scumbag. #masongreenwood <CN> Please I beg I hope I don't read his a sex addict and he needs help I will scream
<HS> Simple really you are an animal abuser or you are not, you get something from causing suffering to a vulnerable living being that cannot defend itself or you don’t and ‘apologies’ and ‘condemnation’ won’t stop this ‘ <CN> Hehehe Maybe the RSPCA should compensate damages caused by these animals. Don't they also hurt us with their damage and cause emotional trauma??
<HS> A shit Ben white <CN> 5-1, 6-2
<HS> [BODY] Just waffle. That’s Ronaldo in finals you spastic <CN> [BODY] Count me the other 13 if you will. What matches and what opposition? And that's the record of an "all time great" who always played surrounded by other "all time greats"

<HS> With all due respect, please gtfo of my club man. You’re atrocious <CN> Yes bro. He was the only one playing from Manchester United. Rest 10 people were management? Atleast stop being a dumb.

<HS> + = Disgusting Karen Brady if you stay silent you should be ashamed of yourself - more concerned on the starting XI than the ethics of the club. What message does it send? You can beat animals and get away with it if you are good enough at football? #ForShame <CN> Couldn't agree more! The fact that West Ham and Karen Brady are withholding the donation they promised due to this piece of sh*t's abuse to a defenceless animal makes them abhorent as he is! They should be ashamed of themselves, I am disgusted at them! #forshame
<HS> and do your jobs and get that scumbag locked up!!! <CN> do hope you'll be punishing him as well. Not some pathetic fine or a slap on the risk.
<HS> #Catslivesmatter you evil man. You are a coward by abusing a defenceless animal is totality inexcusable and for the twat that filmed it I have no words. I expect you to at least give a month’s salary to an animal charity and I hope the take action. <CN> Firstly, the RSPCA must remove any animals from that household. Next, prosecute Zouma, as well as the person filming. All legal costs to be paid by the perpetrator. Vile actions have consequences and he should not be seen as being above the law. They have the proof, use it.

The bloke should be sectioned, not playing PL football. What does this teach kids?! <CN> I fully expect the decent Hammers fans tonight make their feelings known to both Zouma and The Board. He has no place at the club or in football. Sick!

<HS> Mr Zouma, your apology is not accepted amongst us animals, what you did to the cat shows us what kind of a person you REALLY ARE A VILE ANIMAL AB, it’s NEVER ok to kick or slap an innocent animal. You are a disgrace. Shame on you. #Zoumaout #ProsecuteZouma <CN> Right on 💯 stand up for animals
<HS> Dear pls give up the captain armband and quit playing for Please we beg you in God's name. Because you're the most useless human being I've witnessed play football 🥺🥺😔 <CN> fb

<HS> Comments left on the / tweet are very largely a fetid cesspit run off of right wing bile, victim playing and a total lack of empathy. Why are so many people such utter, utter scum? <CN> Anonymity gives them license to reveal their true selves....
<HS> Fucking disgrace. Absolute clown. Immediate Termination of his contract No excuses. <CN> I'd say we chill until it's all proven
<HS> Absolutely sickening should be absolutely ashamed of himself and should banish him from the team. No place for animal cruelty. Imagine being so hard you kick lumps out of your cat! Disgusting to see. #Zouma #WestHam #KurtZouma <CN> What a bastard. I hope he gets sacked.
<HS> Omg this really starting to grind my gears all those arseclowns who have bashed just for giving a shit about families on low incomes and trying to make sure those kids get at least one meal in the hols and telling to stick to footie are dumb and straight up <CN> I would like names and IP addresses and a Lynch Nov fhmor this trash! I would personally happily set fire to this scum! They do t need educating, they need exterminating.
<HS> Fucking absolutely 🐕💩💩 again <CN> Also Luke Shaw should have read that pass and stepped up to play Rodriguez offside. It was a bad judgement call.
<HS> FUCK YOU <CN> Same De Gea who won us the game vs Norwich this season
<HS> Comparing animal cruelty to racism?! you are a bit thick! <CN> He makes a good point you’re just too thick to get it!
<HS> I hate you, you don't deserve to be treated as a human being, you are a monster, being famous doesn't give you the right to treat any animal the way you treated yours. Imagine someone would treat your mother the same way you treated that cat. There's karma, my friend <CN> Hopefully child services pay you a visit. No child should have to grow up with a weaponised autist for a mother.
<HS> Glad I always hated this embarrassment of a footballer. Always knew there was something different about him besides being the most braindead defender i’ve ever seen. Standing ovation when your coffin is lowered into the ground with crane lift you bastard <CN> beside his likkle yute aswell bmt

<HS> Never liked football - I saw the video, I hope will prosecute and will fire that player. you are a psychopath and need to be prosecuted and sentenced for animal cruelty, and never let near an animal ever again. Shame on you!!! <CN> I can’t believe that people are defending him. And that the cat hasn’t been removed from his “care”?! He’s a violent thug and he needs to feel the repercussions of his actions!!!
<HS> if he plays football instead of being sentenced for this crime, i hope someone does to him what did to his cat/cats. absolutely abhorrent behaviour. <CN> If you ain't Vegan you have no right Judging Zouma‼️
<HS> Did anybody else think goal wasn't offside from the view I had on TV it look like it was onside. Or is it me just thinking VAR is a bag of 💩 <CN> Looked very tight but not a clear offside, be interested to see it again on MOTD tonight

<HS> I’m begging you please leave this club <CN> Same man I’m at the phase where it’s a win/win, if he stays, great. If he moves onto psg or Real Madrid, he’ll win a fck ton of trophies and booost his Legacy 😋
<HS> Think it's fair to say, career is pretty much over if this is true... And rightly so, scum! I can assure everyone, if this sort of thing was to ever happen to my daughter, it wouldn't be the scum that went to prison, it would be me! <CN> If true I’d be amazed if it were over. Someone would sign him. Too good a player for a club not to take the stick. Look at lee Hughes for example.
<HS> If only Gulag still exists, that's where you belong you fat headed bozo. Leave my club, you fool. <CN> Maguire still have like 2 years contract

<HS> Thrown away your own career. Broken United fans hearts. Destroyed the life of a young woman. Fuck you <CN> Mason Greenwood is pure scum. But why is everyone not outraged about the Telford scandal, most people haven't even heard of the atrocities or the cover up. Guess because the perpetrator is famous in the first instance.

I hope him and West Ham get their fucking arses handed to them and dragged through the sh1t for how they’ve handled this. <CN> So let’s send a big football message to all the children that it’s okay to kick your pets around because someone was let of lightly for something else and nowadays two wrongs make a right. I unfortunately came across the video, there’s no excuse for this kind of cruelty 😢
<HS> This actually a fucking outrage. I hope u fucking rot in prison, you have ruined this young girls life. U fucking scum bag. <CN> She has now deactivated her insta 5 mins after everything was posted

<HS> West Ham player filmed violently kicking his cat. Doesn’t he understand difference between a simple animal and a football? Horrible man should be prosecuted <CN> Then you mention kicking a dead cat how sick 🤡
<HS> Dumb ignorant and heartless. "I don't condone....but..." There are no 'but's', ever, when a cat gets kicked like a football. Why deflect the subject to a race issue? What a 💩 response. <CN> Didn’t answer the question. You can’t justify what he done by saying “what about this what about that”.
<HS> Still goalless in the league you fat idiot <CN> Looooooolll do it against Watford or Palace in the league first you fat fucking slob
<HS> This man is Graeme Souness. A failed manager. He is Scottish and ex Liverpool; he has just suggested that should not play football ever again this season. This is now spiralling out control. Souness is a just a bloody racist hidden in a cat’s skin. <CN> Souness has shared his opinion on the subject. Because he is a white man being critical of a black man you've called him racist, there is no evidence of this. You wouldn't have said this if Souness was black, therefore you're the racist.
<HS> Shame on you 😡 <CN> What did he do?

<HS> Just to be clear - booting and slapping a defenceless animal around the kitchen is WAY WORSE THAN RACISM. Why is this always the defence? Idiot. <CN> Racist
<HS> Another scummy footballer strikes again. Kurt Zouma terrorising a poor Cat by kicking and slapping the Animal. You are a vile human being nothing clever about what you did just shows people what you are all about.

No good passing , no good shots nothing! Looks bang average at that price! #mufc <CN> People do not really watch the German league, that’s the problem with bringing players from there. It’s a league with defenders of the quality of Dan Burn. Claudio Pizarro is considered a god in that league. Be careful when buying from Germany, it is an asset inflator.
<HS> Should’ve been done earlier but thank goodness there has been some action taken to ensure the safety of the cats #KurtZouma #WestHam you disgust me! <CN> Aye ... what a bastard ..
<HS> Disgrace of human being. Way to be an awful parent on top of an animal abuser. Sick fuck. <CN> Sack him, never let the c unt near a football pitch again. Fucking pig of a human being

<HS> Wow what a prick - big tuff guy slapping a poor Cat around, what a joke of a human being 🖕🏽 <CN> And he still gets in the west ham team tonight, should be suspended & fined 🤬

Nothing will ever change that.

<HS> Nahhhh, if this is legit. Don’t care about the context, the girl said no. Bitch kid get the fuck out of our club you deserve to be in Strangeways you rat 🐀🤮 #Greenwood #GreenwoodOUT #ratzone <CN> Prince Andrew molested 12 year old girls and BBC asked him to make a statement.

<HS> Always knew leigh anne pinnock was a jealous low key bully!! Why doesn’t she call out her racist /bully d*ckhead of a boyfriend !

<HS> SPEAK ENGLISH YOU RACIST <CN> Shit the fuck up rested
<HS> The problem here is NOT , or and FSG but Mo's snake of an agent, imo <CN> Salah's agent is annoying. But don't let that blind you from the real problem, FSG. If you can't keep your best player by offering market competitive wages, then the management of club hasn't grown the club financially despite its recent success. FSG is the real problem.
<HS> What a waste of david silva shirt on that spaniard snake , will accept nothing less than haaland dont u dare get that serbian flop with 0 UCL experience to this club. <CN> Not everyone wants to be a bench passenger and collect undeserved lmedal

<HS> You're a cheat just like the rest of your team. Feigning injury, diving, play acting. Have you got no shame? Perhaps you're proud to be a blantent cheat. Wolves couldn't cope with Leeds so broke the game up by inventing injuries & ref was weak enough to let you get away with it. <CN> And weak enough to give a penalty which wasn't one but ;)
<HS> hope u get hayfever <CN> me too

Absolutely embarrassing #MaguireOut #MUFC <CN> Seems like more and more fans are now starting to realise how bad he really is.

Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <CN> Funny how many fans were convinced that Ronaldo is the problem when the clubs own captain can’t handle the demands
<HS> Go fuck yourself <CN> Looooool

<HS> I am now officially done with this man. Who the fuck does he think he is?? you are finished and have no right to do this towards your own fans. Fuck off. <CN> he just replied to an abusive fan. That is it. Fans follow and pay for them doesn't give them the right to abuse and harass.
<HS> Snake <CN> Not really
<HS> As the old loving slut that I am. I am more than happy to give him one more chance. He has to take it today and god I hope he does! #COYS <CN> He needs a move for his own career at the same time. Need higher tempo / high intensity players vs Liverpool

<HS> Anfield better boo Suarez to hell. Shut up . <CN> You don’t know anything about football…

<HS> I’m sick of bastards like you abusing animals, how dare you do that to an animal in your care, and laughing!!! I hope you get jailed, you nasty evil piece of shit <CN> Why so angry? You really want Kurt Zouma to get jail time for that incident? As bad as it looks, there can be other actions like taking his pets away or forcing him to take some class, but jail time, really??
<HS> Fuck . Trash ass motherfucker <CN> what did he do?
<HS> You are a disgrace. <CN> Well ekun Egbere is legal..... By the way, as it dey pain dem, it still dey sweet us, as it dey sweet us, it still dey pain dem

These things happen in football and he got a lucky escape from a red card but that doesn’t mean you have to come to twitter to say stuff under his posts
<HS> Seeing loads of news articles mentioning "assault & domestic violence". Not one mentioning sexual assault or rape because by the sound of this video that's exactly what he is, a rapist! <CN> Recorded on 22 October 21. WTF she was doing with this dirty lowlife scumbag i will never understand.
<HS> We are shit tbh but you can hold your head up <CN> He kept us relevant for a decade
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> He should never play in a profiteam.

<HS> How the feck some people try to justify F$G n salary bracket n laura lassan...feck give whatever wants. Ffs <CN> Ab toh no justification is left. The contract has to be given no matter what.
<HS> This man is Graeme Souness. A failed manager. He is Scottish and ex Liverpool; he has just suggested that should not play football ever again this season. This is now spiralling out control. Souness is a just a bloody racist hidden in a cat’s skin. <CN> No zouma just booted a cat you fucking moron
<HS> Dont know why we have got norwich fans giving him shit, hes the best player we have had in fucking years and you can hardly blame him for leaving can you, twats <CN> Probably same thing we say about Jack grealish going to city and some city fan saying the exact same thing really

<HS> My I ask why coward, cat beater is playing tonight? <CN> Just silenced the haters with a top drawer performance 🤫 Great call from Moyes to play him, pleased for the lad after a difficult day. COYI
<HS> [BODY] Your talking sh*te Go support a Nigerian team not one from thousands of miles away <CN> [BODY] Why would I cry .laugh more like. Your comments are irrelevant as you live thousands of miles from the UK . support a team from your own country
<HS> Shame <CN> Virgil your mothers pussy fuck you you cunt.
<HS> Kurt Zouma you’re sub human. Will someone rescue that poor cat and any other animals or children in his house #WestHam <CN> The kick was controlled but I did not like the slap at the end. That was nasty.
<HS> Absolute bollocks… thought you were too clever for you’re own good you’re shithousery in the shoot out fucked you up… #KarmaIsABitch <CN> Just watch the shoot out again what a fucking clown you are… #kepa instead of concentrating on saving the penalties you spent all your energy on playing stupid mind games … didnt come close to any of the penalties #clown
<HS> Men will always struggle in society with women whilst maggots like are permitted to think they’re more important than the women in their life. For any male that thinks Mason needs to be listened to, the bruises & the audio are enough. #masongreenwood #unacceptable <CN> I don’t think we should be ‘listening’ to #MasonGreenwood right now, but let’s wait for Due Process before really calling him out. I agree that the evidence at least on the face of it looks damning - but trial by media is hardly ideal…
<HS> Better than 90 million aka one goal wonder pervertz <CN> i like lingard but don't disrespect havertz
<HS> is sh*t 🤡 <CN> Don't insult sh*t please, show it some respect. #OleOut

<HS> Life must be so hard in your £2million mansion on your £30million contract. Kicking a ball for a living about not enough?! I hate footballers at the best of times thinking they're gods amongst us. you are scum & clearly need to look up the meaning of cherished. Dick. <CN> Honestly. It's not like it was even "leaked" - his brother posted it on Snapchat. So, if he's happy a) to do that, and b) to have it shared, what is he happy to do behind closed doors?
<HS> Fuck off you scummy little cunt <CN> Yet you want Ronaldo at your club?
<HS> I hope the City reject wins nothing in his shit career. Oh and make sure you clean that golden boot for before you hand it over. <CN> Remember the time when he swore on his daughter life 🤣🤣
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> Cry more ye fart, doing that to a player that you would still be loving if you had half decent owners . Digne didn't force his way out. Suppose you off out robbing more lucozade bottles for the next game.
<HS> You're shit bro leave the club <CN> Harsh but true

<HS> You are a fraud + KDB is miles clear <CN> Ratio mf
<HS> I have always respected as a club but after playing I never want to see them win a game again. Zouma deserves the book thrown at him and should be facing jail. Takes a coward to hit a defenceless animal. <CN> Yep cos he took a bloody M16 and killed another human being.
<HS> Omg i am disgusted by kicking a cat!! Thats is not alright. He is a absolutely vile😡⚒️ <CN> I feel I can't watch him play again!
<HS> People defending are actual cunts. What he has done is attempt to rape and beat his girlfriend. That voice note is clear as day. No excuses!!!! <CN> Wait!! There are people defending him? 😳
<HS> Come to istanbul son of a bitch <CN> He will come for brake your ass ,be patient ...
<HS> [BODY] Naughty <CN> [BODY] So clear of the Big Shaw
<HS> How do Everton fans still rate he’s pure and utter shite <CN> He has been coasting for a while, super talented though.
<HS> is a cheat <CN> Because he doesn’t like being picked up?
<HS> No one is hopeful that overpaid useless fraud of a footballer wears the shirt or the armband again is the worst centre back and captain this club has ever seen he’s not even good enough for Bolton the only thing he should be doing is rotting in a Greek jail <CN> free us from maguire mcfred rashford and the rest💀💀
<HS> you are the world's biggest wetty <CN> I'd absolutely love to two foot the prick

<HS> As a Manchester United fan I will be disgusted if ever plays for us again. Show him the door #MUFC <CN> Still cheer when Ronaldo scores tho🤔
<HS> come and kick my cat and see how that works out for you! I hope every player of every team you play against tackles you in the head in every match <CN> Just see how vile your heart is. You want players to kick him in the head and you say you don’t have another agenda ? Hazard also kicked a defenseless ball boy. Where is your tweet against it?
<HS> How about keeping more than one Clean Sheet mf? If you're put in the transfer list, nobody, I mean, NO[BODY]YYY is gonna come in for you. That's how shit you are. <CN> You need to shut up MF
<HS> Oh how nice it must be to be a footballer, any regular person does this and they’re locked up for sure… you belong on a kennel you fucking dog. #sendhimtojail #equalrights #disgusting <CN> Every person can get bail it depends on how they bail works
<HS> If doesn't score today, call me a pig pig 🐖🐷🐷🐷. <CN> Huh 😂 wait
<HS> WE DONT WANT YOU AT OUR ANYMORE <CN> Remove Mahrez and you’re spot on
<HS> bro become a fucking teacher if u love kids so much. You should be in prison not greenwood <CN> You are an absolute idiot. Delete your account. Trying to stick up for an abuser disgusting.
<HS> get back to playing or are you worried you can't get in team haaaa enjoy your self isolation.............lazy arse COYB <CN> Is right Yerry lad absolutely fucking shocking a player is enjoying his life while there’s an international break
<HS> Well done Adidas. I would hope that if has any other sponsors they kick him out as violently as he kicked that poor cat. the fact that you haven’t suspended that disgusting individual is absolutely shameful. Suggest your board grow a pair. <CN> Vitality chopped westham too. Good for them
<HS> And this my fellow humans is a prime example of the utterly vile people that we are inflicted with in a daily basis. I would hope that someone kicks the living 💩 out of this excuse of a human being. you are a disgrace to humanity. <CN> Disgusting 🤬🤬
<HS> Get out my clurb <CN> Sam go for English lessons daily

<HS> My I ask why coward, cat beater is playing tonight? <CN> A question we are all asking. I find West Ham's lack of integrity & morals quite shocking.
<HS> Your nightmare <CN> Grow up
<HS> Danny ings might be a prick but how the fuck did make the England squad ahead of him he’s absolute dog shit <CN> By being better in every way? Maybe that.
<HS> Someone just sent me the full video. Disgusting. Hope you lose everything & are prosecuted. Hope that poor cat is with decent humans now. Bollocks to you too if you’re playing him tonight. Bollocks to football for now in fact if this is the case. <CN> a much better 'football' story! 👍
<HS> you spelt it wrong you clown,just like your goalkeeping not good enough <CN> Or he spelled it the Spanish way? Bilingual people do tend to mix languages #Spanglish
<HS> Dead to me now pal Gone from one of my favourites to a nothing person to me Hope you get relegated <CN> Maybe when you’re a bit older, and have more life experience, you’ll look back on comments like this and think what a fool you were.
<HS> Destroy the little fanny <CN> That’s all your lot are good for. Piss poor hit and hope football with some violence mixed in. Fucking dreadful 😆
<HS> You disgust me - you are the lowest of the low and should face charges for what you have done. Horrific animal abuse. Complete scumbag <CN> And to be so monumentally thick as to post it online. His brain cell must be lonely. What a prick.
<HS> [BODY] ur club pays phil jones 110k a week, shut up <CN> [BODY] Spend absurd amount of oil money still and can't win a Champions League.Ur club success are comparable to that of Arsenal lol
<HS> Go to hell .. arsehole <CN> This is a disturbing pattern with him and this latest one is even more despicable.

<HS> It’s absolutely disgusting and inexcusable to see socialising and taking pictures with vile antisemite Wiley <CN> His excuse is absolute rubbish. How did he not know? He’s either ignorant and completely detached from the world, or he doesn’t care about Wiley’s comments. Either way, how on earth could we let a man like that dictate anything?
<HS> You are a DISGUSTING excuse for a human being ! Anyone who abuses animals says VOLUMES about who they really are!! Your brother video taping? Black lives matter and SO DO ANIMALS!!! You are only sorry you got caught! SHAME ON YOU!😠 #animalslivesmatter #RSPCA #KARMA 😤 <CN> Your comments are nothing but utter nonsense. We value human beings more than a stupid Cat. Shane in you for your clueless comments.

Why she would go through the effort of faking them
<HS> Have you written an article about the dark money think tank twats & religious nut jobs like Lilico, who told he shouldn't criticise corrupt AF Patel? They bang on about the left cancelling free speech, it turns out they are hypocritical idiots. <CN> The spin is next level. Unreal.

Fucker needs prosecuted.
<HS> I Think should donate at LEAST a months wages to an animal charity - Then work at LEAST 100 hours for that charity #Shameful #Coward <CN> Good idea, let’s see how sorry he really is. Or is it just words. Empty, pathetic words. He should at least be banned for a couple of games
<HS> Got to love fans turning on a 20 year old lad and blaming your sh*t season on him. #Pathetic would struggle in your Team you Morons. Call him back as this will do more harm than good mentally to 💙 #CFC <CN> Agreed, disgusted & embarrassed by the section of our fans that sang this. He is the only player we have trying to get on the ball and pass it around. Not the loan he needed at this stage of his development and not the player we need given lack of quality in the squad sadly.

<HS> Your shit pal, please move to a different club if they’ll have you <CN> You’re alone, you want to be noticed. You feel the only way is to be hateful and negative. Thing is you won’t get the love you crave back only hate. You’ll become depressed and eventually Suicidal. Save yourself, Put love out into the universe and it will come back to you.
<HS> Remember when was a homophobic nasty vile pig and #LeighAnnePinnock said nothing. #nastyleigh <CN> remember when leigh anne actually called out andre in her documentary and he apologised for it. now let’s also remember how jesy nelson blackfishes daily and hasn’t apologised or given a proper apology. let’s remember how nicki married a rapist and tried to get the victim quiet.
<HS> is a waste of space <CN> Ni 🚮
<HS> bruh, are you fucking blind? <CN> plus, he should have hit him harder

Call him back as this will do more harm than good mentally to 💙 #CFC <CN> What are you on about ? Was small percentage of fans. Would be like me tarring all your fans being racist after what happened in Paris and numerous other issues. Very cun tish tweet.
<HS> Not even a thank you or goodbye post you little rat. You left the best club and manager itw to join a UEL debt team because they used to be good and have a big stadium. Well done for ruining your career aged 21 <CN> You're what's wrong with football fans today
<HS> your fucking dogshit holy shit balls <CN> Get this mf off the pitch
<HS> Hurting a poor defenceless animal reveals you’re an appallingly vile and contemptible person. Apologies mean nothing because why would anyone think it ‘fun’ to hurt an animal in the first place? Abhorrent and disgusting from . Should be a sackable offence <CN> No chance because he’s worth money and money is worth more than morals.

<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> oh shit😂
<HS> Ronaldo is such a clueless d!ck. He says something on Insta and does the exact opposite the next day. Not that I expected your ego bruised ass to do anything else though. 👀 <CN> Probably that means that Pascal ferre spoke facts then 😂 because pura pol khol diya Ronaldo ka usne 🤣
<HS> I really think should leave ASAP. You lazy, lazy bastard <CN> Talks on social like he plays.. shit!
<HS> Scum of the earth 🤬🤬 <CN> I used to had cats all my life. They won't get hurt by that kick. Actually the cat body was hit by his leg and slicing and flown by the acceleration. The cats are different with other pet. If he did that kick to dog or puppy, it gonna pretty hurt them. But cat won't hurt
<HS> U fckin midget when i catch youuuuu . <CN> CRYYYYYY
<HS> Animal cruelty boils my piss - I hate anyone that’s cruel to animals! you f**king piece of shit <CN> His brother even worse filming it...two big hard lads they are aren't they? F*cking filth.
<HS> I think you have to have a fairly disgusting and remorseless person to abuse a defenseless animal like did. Makes you wonder how they torture it when the camera's are off. <CN> My thoughts exactly, makes me sick to my stomach!
<HS> You're trash <CN> This further proves my accusation Gm

<HS> Hurting a poor defenceless animal reveals you’re an appallingly vile and contemptible person. Apologies mean nothing because why would anyone think it ‘fun’ to hurt an animal in the first place? Abhorrent and disgusting from . Should be a sackable offence <CN> Apology because he got caught. If he was an Arsenal player I'd want him sacked.

<HS> pack your bags and go to PSG you child feeding fraud of a player. You’re shitty asf!!!! <CN> You can be disappointed Rashford performance ( which I think is over exaggerated) but why bring up the children who helped to get fed. Absolutely no need
<HS> I don't know what's more embarrassing. posting what he did or the account posting it as news. Maybe Trashfood is meant to remain here, where he can continue to be labelled as a joke by this joke of a club. <CN> The fans are the problem. People more worried about slagging off their player instead of catching the train back to London
<HS> you’re better than Wank Banana <CN> it's not a big achievement
<HS> And played tonight. I'm disgusted. I can't say on here what I want to say to you as I'll be suspended. Spineless, evil 🤬 to you and him. <CN> Tone deaf doesn't even begin to cover it. Disgusting 🤬🤬

You not just only a worse high salary player we've ever signed but even a worse like a person. Hope will never see you in Iron shirt again <CN> Fuck off and stop supporting my club. Go support Chelski
<HS> I'M NEVER PLAYING ULTIMATE TEAM AGAIN !!!! My fooking french fraud at top couldn't score if he's life is on the line!!! FRAUD!!!! And of course his Joa Pedro scores 5 sweaty goals! I have played like 30 games with Joa pedro and he is even shitter than Giroud! <CN> !!!! 🤬🤬🤬
<HS> One thing which angered me which I’m not sure if people saw. #KevinFriend laughed when the crowd sung not fit to ref. Firstly. It’s pathetic he chose to laugh. Secondly he made umpteen incorrect decisions. Thirdly he ignored repeatedly. Moron. #VAR <CN> He was laughing at the CFS as he left the pitch at full time
<HS> You have blood on your hands ya sharmoot <CN> what did he do
<HS> Shut the fuck up <CN> Relax fam before he blocks you too 😭

<HS> Tosser of the month award goes to David Moyes. Thinks starting was acceptable after his disgusting video of abusing a defenceless animal. What on earth does this show to the kids of today Moyes. A huge mistake by manager and club. <CN> Makes them as guilty for condoning it. 😠👹
<HS> 💩💩💩💩 <CN> Red Harry
<HS> Tosser of the month award goes to David Moyes. Thinks starting was acceptable after his disgusting video of abusing a defenceless animal. What on earth does this show to the kids of today Moyes. A huge mistake by manager and club. <CN> Johnny, if Moyes was told ones mother just died his response wold be "but you're fit to play right?" and if you lost a leg due to gangrene he would ask "but the other ones alright hey?". The only thing I admire about him is his pure cuntiness.
<HS> Dead Dutty Stinking .. Sorry 😢 <CN> Kmt
<HS> So commentary states a save was made on their commentary, yet dont pay out! Scum!! <CN> #skybetstealing very clearly for anyone to see that’s a shot on target! Vardy even apologises to his team mates for taking the shot!!
<HS> Did anybody else think goal wasn't offside from the view I had on TV it look like it was onside. Or is it me just thinking VAR is a bag of 💩 <CN> I thought this season the strikers were getting the benefit of the doubt. The issue is the linesman flagged it. And this season VAR seems to not be overturning on field decisions now. Which tbh then what's is the point in var Get rid for me no point
<HS> If George floyd didn't break the law vile criminal then he wouldn't of been killed break the law face the consequences <CN> So why does deeney mention george floyd in the letter above then
<HS> Worst player in this fucking world is please stop playing for Manchester.. go and fight for Ukraine #shitplayer <CN> Ein fight defend li pas cv Qui fight 😂
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> Bros forget youvare a crazy being, how I wished you could coach your street people before bearing Arsenal’s surname MF
<HS> “I am deeply sorry for anyone that was offended by the video” am I the only one that thinks this is the worst formulated apology? Fuck you I hope your cats have been taken off you and has taken action. May you never play football again 🖕🏼 <CN> Whoppa!!! And I wish nothing more! Well said!!

<HS> Bro get a life <CN> Block him you won't see his post anymore
<HS> Good! Absolutely disgusting - says a lot about the kind of person someone is when they treat a poor innocent defenseless animal so horrifically… shame on you and in front of your kids - what kind of message does that send !? <CN> Totally agree on that!
<HS> Very disgraceful behavior. I hope West Ham drop altogether and whatever else needs to happen to ban him from joining any team. <CN> You may think a saint just tweeted. Hypocrisy galore. Mistakes may not define a person.Kosokoso
<HS> Leave ma club loser 🤙 <CN> Why are you sending abuse to him for? You can have your opinions that's completely fine but this is weak man.

But this is so heartbreaking

<HS> It’s no surprise someone with this mentality would feel threatened by the arrival of Ronaldo. If you’re complaining about the demands BEFORE Ronaldo, you’ll never survive alongside him. Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <CN> he'd be killed outside of the Bernabeu or Allianz Arena within 10 minutes for saying this nonsense

<HS> + = Disgusting Karen Brady if you stay silent you should be ashamed of yourself - more concerned on the starting XI than the ethics of the club. What message does it send? You can beat animals and get away with it if you are good enough at football? #ForShame <CN> She is supporting him, yet a female teacher has lost her job for kicking a horse and a no good male football player does the same should be ashamed of themselves
<HS> Fuck you <CN> He must be reminded
<HS> well I guess you're a liar too then <CN> Messi fans are incredible
<HS> fucking retire why the fuck are you so shit <CN> Let's hope he gets a career ending (but not life threatening, he's a c*nt but I'm not a monster lol) injury. Rather than being shit week in week out he can coach other defenders how to be a knobhead like him!
<HS> How can you comment on the matters of India when your own country has banned hijab in public you hypocritical islamic maniac? You are just another nail in the coffin of Islam. STOP BEING AN IGNORANT B***H. #paulpogba #MUFC <CN> Look Movie "The Kashmir File"

<HS> Oh how nice it must be to be a footballer, any regular person does this and they’re locked up for sure… you belong on a kennel you fucking dog. #sendhimtojail #equalrights #disgusting <CN> At the end of the day guys, if this was a regular person with rape, sexual assault and threat to kill allegations against them, they’d already be in jail.

<HS> Good morning to everyone except . Try and kick me you disgrace. <CN> Crazy world bro, what he’s done is unfurrgetable! What a cat-astrophe, he’s got a right meowtain to climb if he wants his career back.
<HS> These are the type of players that we want out of the club immediately.. You're a disgrace <CN> Some of you are deluded blaming lingard. They promised him playing time and chose to stay to fight, hasn’t gotten any, and again when he wanted to leave they didn’t allow him. You’re Damned if u stay and damned if u leave. Don’t see this reaction against Cavani
<HS> if you're found guilty and sent to prison I can only hope someone in the showers treats you with the same respect that you obviously have for women #masongreenwood #Disgusting #NoExcuse #Scum <CN> Jason Parker, tweeting all this WILL NOT get you laid, she still thinks youre a beta loser lol
<HS> Get out of Manchester United, Jesse Dickgard. F**k your mother. Useless headless chicken. <CN> Your hard
<HS> please leave #THFC we know you want to and you are shit right now. <CN> Levy is a master negotiator tho
<HS> Fuck you <CN> Easy nana easy 🤣🤣
<HS> you fucking idiot go home your not good enough 👊😡😡 <CN> You’re an embarrassment to yourself & your family
<HS> You’re shit <CN> Get to bed you
<HS> Please don’t come back <CN> Ur boyfriend is in norway why arent u there with him sucking his dicc and keeping him warm?
<HS> You are a loser Factos👍 <CN> U talking about 2013 and leaving out 2010...u guys are just shameless
<HS> Oh shut up fgs you’re not above 85 if we are being honest looool <CN> He doesn’t know you like that😭🥶
<HS> Any man who assaults a woman should sit behind bars and rot. : you are no exception. United must terminate his contract. <CN> But when ronaldo rapes a minor. Your all good with that
<HS> Fuck You, You Brasilian piece of shit. When will You be able to defend everything, You fuckin piece of shit from Sao Paulo? <CN> What did ederson do boss Ik he fucking shit sometime but this game fucking Laporte fucking Dias and motherfucker cancelo
<HS> Always been a sausage boy ain’t you <CN> blame the squad for not passing to him, most of them just took shots for themselves and missed
<HS> your ma is a slag you dirty little shitbag <CN> Hold
<HS> Our fanbase are an absolute DISGRACE!!! Don’t try tell me Paul Pogba gets ‘fair’ treatment from some of you pussies!!!! Had to remove a picture of him praying cos of abuse by his own fan base!! You are a shit stain on society’s arse!! We love you 💙 <CN> And yet people wonder why he wants to leave. Embarrassing
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> He’s a Villa player. I personally have no issue with him celebrating a goal. If we buy someone I’d want to see him going bonkers if he scored or assisted regardless of who we were playing against. Fans are free to boo all day long but players can’t celebrate a goal. Why is that?
<HS> You were shit again, FACTOS <CN> is that you? 🥴🤣
<HS> Absolutely disgusting behaviour by No excuse whatsoever for what you have done! You not only threw your career away but you have let down the kids and fans who supported you!I hope you get the punishment you deserve and never play for Man Utd again ! <CN> Hope the victim is safe and recovering well. No women should be subject to any kind of violence or be forced to do something they do not want to do. You have let down everyone who had faith or supported you down !
<HS> Look at this you idiots you are so shit but since you have Ole's nude, he can't bench you. <CN> No need to tag them in and abuse is there?? Never a need for that - respectfully look at your own pinned tweet and think of your actions brother
<HS> What’s happened to today is dreadful btw These utter dregs of society who will never achieve anything off their own back place no value on other peoples hard work & sacrifice. They steal so much more than objects when this happens Scum of the earth these folk <CN> The security cam footage looked like something out of a comedy sketch. One genius wearing high vis. Four of them trying to roll a safe across the driveway while the other backs the car in. I don't think they'll be hard to find. The worst part is feeling unsafe in your own home.
<HS> Are you disappointed that you trusted him fans - meet the word twisting weasel Wish him a Merry Christmas <CN> Not the first time we've seen a twisted headline. Often there's a headline writer twists the interview content for clickbait. The article is fine, but nobody would read it if the headline simply said "Phillips wants to stay at Leeds".
<HS> Hope it hurt ye French rat <CN> Come on mate really?
<HS> No don’t come back <CN> Don't spread your hate on his page He is not even talking about arsenal. Some of you are so salty.
<HS> FUCK whoever signed for us MAGUIRE, whoever gave him the badge, whoever starts him in games, FUCK THEM ALL💔 <CN> Say no to racism😂
<HS> No contact what so ever, diving cheat <CN> Always done it and gets away with it, as someone said, he reffed the game well. Big 6 and England biased, we get used to it.
<HS> Thank you for exposing this shower of shit <CN> is it real or was he hacked ?
<HS> Explain this u knobhead? <CN> He just wants to join a better club
<HS> Maguire is stealing a living! Give up the captain band you twat! <CN> Show some respect to the skipper.
<HS> Disgusting, how is this funny in any way? What are you going to do about this Don’t care about his football skills, is a horrible human being and should never be allowed to keep pets again #KurtZouma <CN> I’d pay money to kick him. Animal cruelty sickens me. Hope his sponsors drop him, and preferably his team too. Vile oxygen thief
<HS> Leave my club please <CN> you do know that he kept us in the game last night and not at the bottom of league table
<HS> ⁦⁩ you are a fucking arsehole I hope the ⁦ see this and ban you from keeping pets! I hope someone does the same to you! #AnimalCruelty #WestHam ace #KurtZouma filmed KICKING and slapping his pet #Cat in horrific video <CN> The RSPCA should visit to check the poor animal is ok and remove it from him. I will be complaining about this to them.
<HS> Me : Sebastian, why can’t you do as you’re told? Sebastian : I can’t because everyone keeps shouting Mo Salah Me : What are you talking about you plonker? Sebastian : He runs down the wing #crying 😂 <CN> Good job I like you both 👊🏻👍🏻❤️
<HS> Fuck you , Arsenal just send this guy to wherever he wants to go. Disgraceful. <CN> It’s arsenals fault we literally had a cup game and benched him
<HS> So you're homophobic? <CN> ofc
<HS> Imagine a grown man bullying and abusing a wee poor defenseless animal. Absolutely sick hope you rip up his contract. Harming animals is the start. Who knows what he is capable of. Big hard man booting a wee cat. Scum! <CN> He vollyed a cat he is a prick. Overpaid wankers with no morals. Sums up that league.
<HS> Fuck you, <CN> I'll second that. Maybe Zouma would like to be kicked and slapped. What a pos.
<HS> If Arsenal signs some poops or cow dunks in the near future.. it would still be same World Class for you losers. <CN> Welcome Aaron Ramsdale to Arsenal Chek it out Please like and subscribe my youtube channel 🙂
<HS> Disgrace of human being. Way to be an awful parent on top of an animal abuser. Sick fuck. <CN> Tbh who ever filming it just as sick. And that poor kid man. He needs help I have no idea why anyone would own animals to do this.
<HS> Fkin disloyal c1nt . He protected you when you were down, when you were stinking the whole place up remember that👍 <CN> No other manager would have started him this season but Ole has trusted him. Not sure if he's turned against Ole or not but it's always sad how players do that to their managers.
<HS> [BODY] 11 goals in the league last year. Dogshit buddy. Bye <CN> [BODY] Firmino had 9, mane 11. same and worse than rashford under the logic you are using they both are now "dogshit buddy" bye.
<HS> The support by the is rather quiet. The most noise I heard out of them was in dismay at their own players or to boo at (who is a cunt) and walking out with 15 minutes still to go is just disrespectful. <CN> Know him personally do you?
<HS> #lufc why do they call scum? Is it anything to do with Ryan Giggs being a wife beater, Ronaldo being a sex offender and now rapist ? Nice family club. <CN> The document about Cristiano Ronaldo. "she said no" is fabricated. Kathryn fraud Mayorga was never raped. She didn't tell the Police his name or where it happened. Kathryn Mayorga Is a racist golddigger fraud women who takes drugs and narcotic.
<HS> You have no respect for cat 😡😡😡 You go back to africa now!!! 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 <CN> you go to psychology
<HS> It’s time tonight to go back to being a bully ! <CN> he is a flat track bully, doesn’t have the bottle in games that matter
<HS> Before I sleep. YOU'RE SHIT!!!!!! <CN> Respect the captain 🙏🏽
<HS> I M P A C T 🤝 <CN> so happy he got a goal today but i recon he will be sold this month
<HS> You're fucking wank mate, worst captain I've ever seen. Team is full of defenders who've no clue how to defend. <CN> What a fucking pleb you are
<HS> PLEASEEEEE LEAVE MY WE DONT WANT YOUUUUU <CN> pain jogba may end up going with him STAYYYY
<HS> Embarrassing <CN> When he wasn't missing sitters, he was throwing himself to the ground.
<HS> 😡😡 <CN> That poor lad could have caught his eye off camera not assume a selfy in a post match interview..some people are just born idiots.
<HS> Let’s go Tammy ratio that knobhead <CN> crying 😭
<HS> Pathetic hiding behind a screen <CN> Doesn’t even make sense. This threads about football you muppet.
<HS> Shut up and get your own head down. You’re playing too badly <CN> Come on mate... Wtf is this?
<HS> Hope karma comes right back around and punishes . What a horrible piece of work. <CN> He’s a vile bastard Should be prosecuted
<HS> leave the club u twat <CN> Havertz avi
<HS> Ignorant. Egoistic. Selfish. <CN> Maybe because of all his fantastic charity work to feed under privileged kids he has no motivation to applaud a bunch of cretins who spend 90 minutes chanting "feed the scousers" & calling them "bin dippers." Move club Marcus,you're too good for those scumbags.
<HS> if the allegations are true you need to face up to them and serve your time. #Disgusting #Appalling #Shameful <CN> Yeah Fans of Arsenal here's some help Greenwood is going 2 jail maybe u can get 4th 🥳
<HS> You re just tooooooooooo useless this season and you can get the fuck out of the team if you like 😡 I guess the MBE makes you feel like you re too important😡😡😡😡 Useless player 😡😡😡😡😡 <CN> This kin thing de sweet me

<HS> FUCK OFF Not offside! You cant accept a class goal! Salty muppet. <CN> Shut up
<HS> U r literally rtarded and haven't seen a single game in ur life. U r srsly on drugs <CN> I've exposed your average knowledge of football. You know nothing about football believe me. Donm' t even kid yourself thinking you do. You're just like them ignorant lot who argue based off feelings. You're a naive person
<HS> Please leave We don’t want you, you’re a trash can <CN> Ratio
<HS> I honestly can’t believe there are people defending and slagging off the female that came forward. This is the reason they don’t come forward. I’m a United fan but I hope he gets sent down. Disgusting! <CN> Yeah was just about to say this. Wtf it’s mad how people are defending him. Sack him. He should never play again
<HS> Please don't come back <CN> Same top reds that said ole was fergie haha

<HS> I hate you <CN> You’re going too far with this...
<HS> Did seriously say he won the ball? The same Kane who swore on his daughters life that he scored a goal when he didn't? That Harry Kane? Dickhead <CN> He's the media darling he has special rules that apply to him
<HS> Get off the field ASAP 💩 <CN> Oh gosh relax na boy
<HS> Fuck you <CN> He's married. You can have me
<HS> This is appalling by how can Zouma possibly be starting after that video?! Surely there needs to be some kind of punishment before he is back in the limelight. Scummy. Proper scummy. <CN> Hope someone goes through him.
<HS> What have you f**kin done 😶😡😠😤 <CN> why am I tagged?😭😭

<HS> What a pussy you are ? Breaking • #WatfordFC striker Emmanuel Dennis will not go to AFCON - Nigeria FF official release confirms he has been “excused”. #FPL <CN> Can’t believe what I’ve just read. 😳
<HS> I really think should leave ASAP. You lazy, lazy bastard <CN> I would while he has a high market value. Get shot of him, martial, Fred, mata, Matic, awb and probs a few more. Cavani will be gone, get rid of Ronaldo as well. Need about 5 new signings ha

<HS> Well done 👏🏿👏🏿, life time footy ban, and some jail time is needed, for the little rat once found! <CN> Typical Leeds that!!! Firm of dickheads them lot.
<HS> Maguire is fucking dog shit <CN> Thought you said mental health matters?
<HS> The Giants of Africa always have the last laugh, cry b*tch <CN> people acc once said mahrez is better than salah the disrespect 🤨
<HS> It takes real dedication and focus to be as shit as and <CN> I thought Shaw had turned a corner waisay but this season he is back to Jose wala Shaw
<HS> These are the type of players that we want out of the club immediately.. You're a disgrace <CN> Let’s be honest with or without a Jesse Lingard we still should’ve beat that shit lot! All this hype around Hannibal pre game and he didn’t even get a sniff. I no longer feel it when we lose so disconnected from the club certainly won’t be renewing my ST next season
<HS> Terrible again get out of my club <CN> Check out what arteta said #ramsdale #Gabriel Retweet appreciated Please subscribe my youtube channel
<HS> Oh look, another piece of shit footballer thinking they can do what they like. would love a little donation from you <CN> As if it wasn’t bad enough that he did it, but the person filming it is laughing like it’s the funniest thing they’ve ever seen. Totally disgusting.
<HS> Saul Niggaz🔥🔥🔥 <CN> Niguez *
<HS> Fuck you and fuck Manchester City, you let us down greatly so far you legend 💔💔💔 <CN> And there u stopped be A Spurs fan.
<HS> U were terrible. Embarassing to the club. <CN> We know your not a city fan even looking at your profile
<HS> You’re such a loser 😭😂 the kid is 19 and he had you in his pocket, so you try step up up to him like you’re at a bar in Digbeth wanting to throw hands. Smh. Just retire with grace, quietly. 🤷🏻‍♂️ <CN> Love how G Hamer is calming the situation 😅🤷 he's changed lol
<HS> You are disgraceful to football <CN> Fxck off
<HS> Shame on you Hope you get the same treatment, in your face. <CN> Put some dirt in his eyes 😂
<HS> Shame on you for bringing race into this to pull focus away from what he actually did. Good mate, shit person. <CN> Yet nothing is said when bought up racism ? If that wasn’t mentioned he wouldn’t have bought up Michail wouldn’t have mentioned it. Think before you speak especially on an app like this. You can’t pick and chose.
<HS> Sex education is too sick I recommend it <CN> Shut the fuck up
<HS> DECLARE FOR CANADA YOU SNAKE <CN> Has an England cap doesn’t he
<HS> Shut up <CN> Um

<HS> 1 So my 11 year old son has quit his football team this week as a couple of team mates have told him he's he's terrible player! U get some reet horrible little twats! His confidence is down! He a good player can we have a like to pick him up <CN> My Grandson was the same Stephen. But he stuck at it. He's now the standout player in his side, and is playing for his County side. The bullies didn't progress, and are nowhere to be seen. Unfortunately it's something that's always happened. Even when I was a kid, and I'm 65 now
<HS> leave United u fucking twat…Can’t even hit a pass <CN> Respect Rashford. He is a great philanthropist.
<HS> Shush were shit <CN> Are you dumb
<HS> Man City are special😅 They will walk the league. Makes me feel sick that it doesn't matter how shit and useless is and has been, he will lift the Prem at the Emptyad against Villa <CN> Didn't even clock that! Yeah, they will lift it against us won't they! 🤦🏽‍♂️🙉😫
<HS> Join the back of the queue for being taken seriously you dope <CN> I think he’s a shining light me
<HS> i don’t like you <CN> And no one likes you
<HS> You are a massive fraud if you leave the club because we went to europa <CN> 😭😭😭 It gets worse?
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> Well said very disturbing watching that video , his cats need to be removed ASAP, they must be terrified of him
<HS> Still dickless <CN> RATIOOO MOTHERFUCKERRRR 2-0
<HS> You said something similar last week ffs, try getting Mason into a room and kicking his cunt in until he learns to pass the ball now and again. 🤷 <CN> What a nice chap you are, Stuart.
<HS> What a thunderbastard from !!!!? <CN> Another one!
<HS> Oxlade Chamb is fucking shit. Fuck off out my club. Part time footballer full time social media influencer <CN> bruh too far
<HS> Not Keane, not Giggs, not Scholes... But , a man with 4 relegations, the worst mentality I've ever seen in a player and a man with less ability than most players in the league, is apparently a "true example" of a MUFC player according to Ole. Standards =💩 <CN> Ideas must change in the club. Everything must change. Look at Liverpool when they got rid of players who failed and announced Klopp after 30 years. A football is changed United should changed We want playing football Ten haag or Ralph must coming in any price #OleOutNow
<HS> Ronaldo is such a clueless d!ck. He says something on Insta and does the exact opposite the next day. Not that I expected your ego bruised ass to do anything else though. 👀 <CN> What do you expect from rapist
<HS> You're shit I pray lingard takes your place😂 <CN> Make sure you type this in Ronaldo’s tweet later
<HS> you are an embarrassment to this club and all it stands for. We are watching a saboteur <CN> Notice he didn’t even celebrate when varane header went in. Convinced this guy is playing against us
<HS> you’re scum <CN> Hasn't been charged for anything yet how do you know that
<HS> feel free to piss off w him <CN> touch grass
<HS> Im absolutely fuming seeing this man… Beating on a helpless defenseless cat, sick vile person <CN> This is not acceptable .. Should be punished asap
<HS> This is how REAL MEN treat Cats #KurtZouma - Take note and man up you slimeball 😡 <CN> This river runs past my mum and dads back garden, well a hundred yards away from it.
<HS> Fuck off u are embarrassing #avfc #trezeguet <CN> Trez learning from the best.
<HS> Get the hell out of our club <CN> His club more than it's yours. Piss off to City #GGMU
<HS> Miserable bugger 😂😂 <CN> 😂😂 between them and it’s all I’ve heard pal!
<HS> Don’t smile pal you was shit again <CN> no way a Harry Kane stan is calling someone else shit 💀
<HS> You should be in jail <CN> Hell nah
<HS> As soon as has the ball tonight I hope he launches it straight at simeone’s bollocks! #horriblebastard <CN> Take it you don't like him then oz lol

<HS> "Thanks God!" God doesn't support any football team you moron <CN> Thanks God because he gives all glory to God. Sorry thought that was obvious mate.
<HS> Even with the assault being a alleged offence the audio proof of you trying to force her to have sex is disgusting horrible creature you are...what a waste 🤬 <CN> Just seen it all. Fucking heartbreaking for the young lass, I hope she’s ok and getting the help she needs to recover from this. Mason Greenwood needs to go to prison.
<HS> Soo many ppl in the comments are actually lacking home training your mothers should’ve swallowed you fvckin lowlife pr!cks <CN> How can you call people low lifes after saying that?
<HS> Maybe stop chewing gum in a game you clown - and clear the ball correctly. #avfc <CN> wasteman init. hows dis guy our fkn captain🤦🏾‍♂️

If you're not playing for Ole, play for the fans you absolute melt 🤬🤬 <CN> We need a flying boots and smashing things inside the dressing room again. No doubt about that. This good guy/friendly management style is not working!
<HS> Can’t wait to see the back of you and you disgusting French players with bad attitude. BYE! <CN> When have martial or pogba displayed bad attitude?
<HS> If a woman can abuse a horse and get arrested then what’s the difference ? #scum 🤬🤬🤬🤬 <CN> A horse can fight back? 🤷🏻‍♂️
<HS> You’re a virus at my club, please leave <CN> lukaku is still in your club man

<HS> Marcus rashford, an absolute disgrace you do this. No passion, no desire, no effort. Hopefully you leave the club. Backed you for so long and you treat the fans like this. Entitled prick. <CN> Lol they can throw abuse and he can’t react? He’s human after all.

<HS> If you generally believe is being targeted for hurting that poor animal is purely a racist attack please block me or unfollow me. I don’t have any interest in socialising with any idiot that truly believes it. <CN> Johnny ... I don’t believe it’s a racist attack but media seem to have an agenda. Atrocious behaviour from a professional footballer but are public looking for over and above Max club punishment pending any further legal action ?
<HS> asif he’s turned into a 🐖 <CN> Was a great guy and player for us mate
<HS> Thank you for everything fuck Rafa fat Spanish waiter <CN> He’s gonna be loved at Villa mate

I hope the lady gets the support she needs 😡😭
<HS> ain’t worth that at all goodbye nigga <CN> People crying about him leaving una he's a good player but TT's 3 atb is what makes him stand out, bring me De Ligt so we can go to a back 4 again.
<HS> [BODY] Just waffle. That’s Ronaldo in finals you spastic <CN> [BODY] Very cutely cropped screenshot 🤡70% of those goals are of pre-season shields and Club world Cup matches vs Al Alhi and Gremio
<HS> If you commented under post last night because you didn't like what he tweeted, then you ain't Chelsea and you're a sad sad little mug who needs to grow up and take a long hard look at yourself. <CN> They have no understanding of what friendship is or why someone would complement a friend on a great performance. This is presumably because they have no friends of their own? 🤷‍♂️
<HS> EXACTLY 💯. . . #LAKAKA IS SHIT. <CN> There is need for an honest conversation with him possibly.
<HS> Is this you #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser, absolutely disgusting. #WestHam #France #EmmanuelMacron <CN> Absolute scum🤬🤬

<HS> with the ultimate shithousery <CN> Hello, Can I introduce ur video on my instagram? I will write ur credit!
<HS> [BODY] useless <CN> [BODY] Did ya see bits of his defending today? He’s done mate
<HS> Tw <CN> Dirty Dunc , please have a word ?
<HS> I wish this was more like ryan giggs Nigga is too fuckin selfish, useless talent. <CN> He’s selfish don’t mean he’s useless. I really like him
<HS> He's blackkkkkk!!!! <CN> Back*
<HS> I absolutely hate <CN> Lethal goal scorer!
<HS> Fuck off <CN> Strange that. Don’t see a ‘Fuck off Ragnick’ tweet? How come?
<HS> That footage of is vile and disgusting. Who on earth does something like that?! He's only sorry because he got caught.

Needs to be sacked and forgotten.

Clubs on its arse from 14 years of Ashley nowt else, don’t forget that. #NUFC <CN> He had an impossible task yesterday. He's a diamond in the mud.
<HS> A country that legalise abortion but put strong measures against harm on pets have no humanity in them but animality. F*ck UK, F*ck westerners #FreeZouma. . . . Adidas Abeokuta Odogwu Atiku Herpes Airpeace Biafra #olosho #oxlaid <CN> If the person in question wants to abort...she has every right to do so. It's her body. There shouldn't be a law preventing such a thing. If there is, then human rights depletes. So UK is totally right if they legalize abortion. As for animals, they can't think for themselves..
<HS> Scum <CN> That cat better be removed and this thug better be kicked of the team.
<HS> Someone just sent me the full video. Disgusting. Hope you lose everything & are prosecuted. Hope that poor cat is with decent humans now. Bollocks to you too if you’re playing him tonight.

<HS> That's a fucking red card for 100%. [BODY] officials are a fucking joke. What will it take, a broken leg. Arseholes <CN> [BODY] Even that wouldn't make a difference. Its all about those Manchester loving wankers not the game. Robbed 100%

<HS> Racism hurts yr feelings & is a trillion% disgusting But physically booting & punching a defenceless animal that won't fight back has 100 times more pain & suffering than words from a nasty person It's a cheap comparison M-A You're trying to deflect his action <CN> Wow. I think you need help mate.
<HS> your mates are allowed to sit at the same table you know? Or even Blackjack if you knew how to card count, but we already established you are shit for brains. <CN> I don’t play blackjack either, not enough money in it… well I did have some good wins when I was in Vegas.

<HS> Lost at half time to league one Morecambe…. Tinpot <CN> How can you even comment when you went out 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
<HS> this guy needs sacking. What a gross person! Who treats animals like this & finds it funny. If he worked for me he’d be suspended tmrw & a disciplinary process would ensue. Nice role model to the young fans! 🤢🤮 <CN> Very well said! Cruelty on any level should be a criminal offence! If not dealt with, it can escalate, and as role models go this man should be made an example of to highlight his actions and behaviour are entirely unacceptable 😞
<HS> "I asked you politely and you wouldn't do it" You miserable piece of sh*t <CN> Never liked that kid and i never will.
<HS> Hope you get thrashed. Your not a Utd player any more in my eyes. Turncoat. <CN> Wait what.

<HS> I can actually wound cristiano one on one, i hate him so much much!!! <CN> My hate for him is too much now, because the man doesn’t even know what sportsmanship means.
<HS> The world was a better place when I knew absolutely nothing about ’s life away from football. What a garbage person. <CN> Garbage !!

<HS> Zuma sutira macku sve ti jebem da ti jebem moroncino raspala <CN> Nije ovo Zuma on nije tetoviran
<HS> Hurting a poor defenceless animal reveals you’re an appallingly vile and contemptible person. Apologies mean nothing because why would anyone think it ‘fun’ to hurt an animal in the first place? Abhorrent and disgusting from . Should be a sackable offence <CN> That means eating an animal should also be a sackable offence. I see nothing wrong in what Zouma did. We always want to create issues out of nothing.
<HS> fuck off <CN> free Donny , fuck off
<HS> Hope you will soon meet a barbarian like you, who treats you like you treated your poor cat!! Fucking IDIOT!! #ZOUMA <CN> What the hell is wrong with y'all? Y'all getting enraged for a damn cat to the extent of threatening to ruin a man's life? Is this what you call compassion? A man's life compared to the life of a cat?!

<HS> . was just a shit. I was waiting for his Insta post since the derby defeat and found none so far. I believe at least he is realising how bad he has been recently. <CN> Bruno should be dropped and replaced by Mata. Atleast that will send a message to Bruno
<HS> Useless player. God has punished you! <CN> Better than your Fred and Mc
<HS> I seriously can’t wait till the day fucks of my club <CN> 20m take it or leave it
<HS> you a sh1t footballer, never come back to chelsea <CN> why are you like this

<HS> Let's get this trending and get that dirty bastard banned. The [BODY] need to look into this. <CN> [BODY] no retrospective punishment if the ref (and the VAR) see it.
<HS> Disgusting player <CN> Brogba might be more than just a friendship 👀

<HS> Rio ... U gunna be farting mate <CN> FACT
<HS> Give your head a wobble! Stop posting shite on social media trying to instigate a move as you're employed by Manchester United. Made yourself look as ridiculous as your daft Tiktok dancing. Absolute epitome of a 'Modern day footballer' I'm afraid. Pathetic. <CN> Work hard to get in the team! Grow up. The sooner everyone moves on from FC Footballer, the better. Weird lot, you lot. Play for the fucking shirt!
<HS> You’re next MF <CN> Mf has a huge bald spot, he'll never get his hair cut
<HS> XOOOOG SHIT LFG <CN> XOOOOG!!!!!!!!!!!
<HS> Hurting a poor defenceless animal reveals you’re an appallingly vile and contemptible person. Apologies mean nothing because why would anyone think it ‘fun’ to hurt an animal in the first place? Abhorrent and disgusting from . Should be a sackable offence <CN> He’s just sorry he’s been caught. I’m no expert but believe his issues go further than kicking a cat.

<HS> you idiot! <CN> What happened?
<HS> Have you seen this sickening footage of kicking and abusing his defenceless cat.🤬😡 <CN> According to Wikipedia Zouma is named after Kurt Sloane, Jean-Claude Van Damme's character in the 1989 film Kickboxer. There you go!
<HS> People actually believe the man who said Rangnick won’t join United. He’s a fraud, thanks Rashford <CN> I won't believe until the coach speaks about it. However the chances are slim and even if things like this are happening, it shouldn't be expose to the media. It's rather making the situation worse
<HS> Why isn’t is a cunt trending on Twitter yet? <CN> Haha you are a patron for the animal kingdom

<HS> That’s definitely his voice. is a fucking scumbag… <CN> I believe in rehabilitation hope he learns his lesson become better human being other people learn from this.
<HS> If #mufc actually give that lazy French twaaat £500k a week then the club is officially run by agents and players!! Ridiculous state of affairs. <CN> Might as well give it us to go down the pub with. The end result will be equally messy, unproductive and ultimately pointless

<HS> Absolute rubbish. Stop apologising. Players should be banned off social media. Get fighting for the crest on the jersey or pack your bags <CN> Honestly sick of this shit. Fair enough if we lose by 2 or 5 every week but go down fighting, do it for the club from sir Matt and Jim Murphy to Munich and the babes and a whole lot more instead of apologising. Last months wages should have been donated to charity by all. Pride??
<HS> Right I’m off to sleep! Goodnight all oh and is a massive cunt 👍☺️ <CN> Cat pub...You have no idea

<HS> Fair play anyone saying his mum deserved it because she threw first needs to give their head a wobble. Blokes shouldn't hit women, EVER. If you think it's OK to hit a women you were raised by a complete twat. #foden <CN> No you shouldnt but she hardly helped. She isnt innocent behaved like a fishwife with a foul mouth. If she had stayed in the room it wouldnt have happened...if she hadnt shoved him it wouldnt have happened. Her behaviour escalated the situation, and she had laid hands on him
<HS> Waste Ham 🤥 <CN> Clever. Very apt at the moment. ⚒️
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> What do you expect after bellends in the crowd were booing him?
<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> “Mum can you film me out in the garden a sec? I just need to do something for Twitter likes.”
<HS> Shit player <CN> Cry
<HS> Another scummy footballer strikes again. Kurt Zouma terrorising a poor Cat by kicking and slapping the Animal. You are a vile human being nothing clever about what you did just shows people what you are all about. The list keeps coming with these tossers <CN> What a moron! West Ham should discipline or even suspend such a dangerous person, even in front of a child, disgusting!!
<HS> Front page headline tomorrow in the … turns out the ill spoken Wally who told the hero to “focus on the day job!” …. Has a second job lol. What a numpty <CN> One of many numpties Chris in the Govt. Biggest one asked on 3 occasions to keep his mask on during hospital visit but didnt. Numpty too nice
<HS> Got your eyes on the next person who could join the list of people who accused you of rape?? With your little pecker. <CN> Why are you here? Go and support the golddigger fraud Kathryn Mayorga...
<HS> A sublime finish from for at but rather than giving Raz due credit the emphasis is all placed on poor defending - pathetic, but predictable commentary. You’d think Andy Hinchcliffe was a 5x Ballon d’Or winner - he’s a snide shite🤬 <CN> Goal in the 5-1 after that??
<HS> You’ll never play again <CN> Bottle of piss in his hand 🤦🏼‍♂️
<HS> NO FUCKING WAY don't u dare <CN> So u will change ur team if he leaves?

<HS> You’re a bad person <CN> Hahaha that surely was naughty !! Not once but twice !! A very bad boy indeed 😎
<HS> Are you totally thick?We know you people who kick balls, earning abhorrent salaries are not known for brains,but what has Zouma abusing a cat got to do with racism? Stop the race card.Zouma abusing an animal with sentient feelings is not acceptable. He will be prosecuted, rightly <CN> Simon really I don't think he understands, maybe he missed out on his education as many footballers seem to do & it's obvious he deems animal cruelty to not be important.
<HS> All time scumbag You shouldn’t be a part of society you lowlife <CN> Welp, it was nice knowing this account. See you soon, I’ll follow back.
<HS> rat <CN> Ratio
<HS> This clown still thinks everything revolves around him. For once in your life, be happy for your team mates. You're an absolute joke. <CN> Sad part is you KNOW the cameras would be watching... Them lips will be read... You're out your team is winning, be happy. The Dub is always more important.
<HS> Don't you dare <CN> Salah going easy on united for 89 minutes then Scoring a Screamer in the 90th minute to win us the match
<HS> . should be nowhere near this team! 🤬 Absolutely useless! Playing with 10 men all the time <CN> It was 9 bro, had maguire playing for most of the game😂😂

<HS> So you cowardly shithouse - have seen enough in the video shot by your gobshite brother to seize your “cherished” cats from you! Hope you’re prosecuted too. really shit decision to play him last night Moyes is a disgrace #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> The attempted justification of playing him by Moyes was pathetic. The fact Zouma didn’t say no speaks volumes about how little he cared about the backlash.
<HS> Mind the gap, you gutless prick! <CN> Where’s CT’s one. 💉 it
<HS> Ridiculous beyond belief. City feel #THFC should be the ones doing something?? Are you f**king me? Now I don't want us to accept that £150m if it ever comes.

Sod off <CN> we would like to buy kane, levy and you dont wanna sell so could you just make a comprimise please and accept less money
<HS> Get Ole and Pogba OUT! Disgrace! <CN> Pogba🤣🤣 what happened to Bruno

<HS> Well done Career down the drain because you are despicable 👍 Hope you’re released later today. <CN> Hope he gets what he deserves in prison.
<HS> If the videos of are true. He should be jailed for years and the key thrown away. Domestic violence is the lowest of the low and beyond disgusting. <CN> Where is the basic respect for another human 😢 more education, less privilege.
<HS> Wait, shouldn't there be something in contract that states he doesn't get paid if he refuses to be part of the squad? get rid of all of these soft cunts, people have died for this club !!!!!!!!!!! #MUFC <CN> There should be but this club has got rid of its discipline

<HS> Jacob Harry Maguire....hands down the worst captain in the history of Manchester United football club and one of the worst players to have ever put on a red shirt !!! You're an absolute disgrace to the shirt !!!! #MUFC <CN> I've said this for years but hardly anyone ever agrees with me. Within the first 2 minutes of the game he made a howler. I've seen more movement from a fridge. Utd won't be great again as long as we have Mr Maguire
<HS> Pussio letting a 19 year old go before you. Fuck off. <CN> Didn’t the guy in your avi just drop a disasterclass?
<HS> When ever in the history of mankind did anyone say, that a lesbian,gay, trans or whatever is Not allowed to attend/play football? This is becoming a joke now, why does anyone need to tell anyone about their sexual interests and orientation? <CN> Thousands of times. Just because you yourself haven't experienced it, doesn't meant it doesn't happen

Just retire with grace, quietly. 🤷🏻‍♂️ <CN> He’s still part of the greatest ever commentary. Seeing the hope drain out of the faces of Leicester fans afterwards was a joy to watch.
<HS> Aw what have you done Tbh I refuse to believe that you could be that stupid however if you have been, that’s your career over before it’s started mush Slink <CN> Hes a little divvy with no sense of reality mate. Them recordings are awful mind
<HS> Right now I hate Greenwood more. Fuck you for making us short of options . <CN> As you continue hating him he'll always be the only person that can bring happiness to Manchester United

<HS> You are a fool together with the likes of Telles and Ronaldo, Manchester United is just a name but in real sense they ain't united at all, foolish club with foolish players, go to hell <CN> You aren’t okay..you need to test your mental health 🥶
<HS> How the fuck does this cunt actually think he went in fairly and got the ball? He literally gets away with shit like this every game! Fucking poes <CN> Rules for the England Captain...and rules for everyone else!

<HS> If you have any respect for United fans you’ll step aside you freaking loser! You are awful. <CN> Using the word awful to describe your performances is an insult to the word awful. Horrendous. Pathetic.
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> How they can consider playing him is beyond belief he should be prosecuted their board of directors their manager should hang their heads in shame
<HS> Kurt Zouma you’re sub human. Will someone rescue that poor cat and any other animals or children in his house #WestHam <CN> Why doesn’t somebody in the city he lives with or who knows him report him. What the F

<HS> Yaah our manager is shit <CN> Man, I'm glad you agree. We need to see the light or else we'll end up like arsenal. Dude needs to start reasoning like he needs trophies bana
<HS> It didnt even happen today you little fanny <CN> Thugs
<HS> VILE WORTHLESS 💩 any child with love for animals would've been screaming crying shouting STOP STOP and saving the cat but did this one NO he DIDNT shows it runs in the family animal abuser mentality saying sorry Won't change the cats mindset for what you've done <CN> This is absolutely heartbreaking and disgusting. There’s no call for this kind of behavior. Anyone who supports this, or finds it funny needs to have their heads examined.
<HS> Pathetic 😡 <CN> Púdrete

<HS> michail antonios comments regarding racism show just how thick, uneducated and stupid he is. He clearly is too dense to understand that what zouma did was the act of a filthy cowardly piece of scum #MichailAntonio #KurtZouma #WestHam <CN> You think you're making sense? So Zouma's contract should be terminated, made to beg for meal cos of a cat? He was fined £250,000, he apologized and I think we should move on. The punishment is harsh
<HS> U play for an oil club plus you fell off snake 🐍😭😭 <CN> W

Rent free in everyone’s head 💙🤍
<HS> so kicking cats is acceptable in your opinion then? If you think that c**t Zouma shouldn't be terminated over it then you really think little of animals.

What are you going to do about this Don’t care about his football skills, is a horrible human being and should never be allowed to keep pets again #KurtZouma <CN> As disgusting as it is it doesn't need sharing.

Standing ovation when your coffin is lowered into the ground with crane lift you bastard <CN> world might be better off if france gets nuked una

<HS> Any company that sponsors moving forward can go to hell as far as i’m concerned. Shouldn’t ever have another club but he will because some clubs have zero morals. <CN> They didn’t sponsor him the knowledge this all would have happened…. stop being a sensationalist and wait for the right court proceedings to happen
<HS> As expected Paul Scholes is on TV blaming for everything and not Ole. We have jealous traitors as legends. #OleOut #shutup <CN> United ex players should never be listened to when decisions are to be taken. If Ole wasn't an ex player, he'd have been sacked years ago.
<HS> I hate you 😡 <CN> Ffs started him over ramsdale!
<HS> Potch is mid table Manager.... Ten Haag or Ragnick.... first Order of business is bench the Useless slab Head <CN> Ten Haag is who you need to get.

<HS> Get the fu*k out u clown 78 mins too late <CN> Win 4-0 completely dominate the second half and you still aren’t happy, I feel bad for you!
<HS> As expected Paul Scholes is on TV blaming for everything and not Ole. We have jealous traitors as legends. #OleOut #shutup <CN> Pogba came in when we were 4 down. The idiot should direct his hate to his former team mate.
<HS> Pack yer bags ya Spanish poof <CN> 🤣🤣👎👎
<HS> How can you “mix up” the absolutely unforgettable with anyone unless you are, at best, utterly, completely and totally useless ? <CN> Oooooh Prime Minister I've done another whoopsie!
<HS> #WatfordFC booing whiles he's laying down injured... scumbags will be scumbags. Losers will be losers lmao #GoBlues <CN> Chelsea fans singing “let him die” while a Watford fan was being treated for a heart attack. Levels.
<HS> Top 4 chance wasted some dung cunts still about get out sharpen yourself, literally lost to a shite United team <CN> Not that shite though
<HS> According to the hashtag that's trending you can't be rich and a Socialist. They're the best kind you anal dwelling butt monkeys, the ones willing to pay more tax and invest time to support the needy. See also <CN> I’m ok then, even my lottery ticket result tells me I owe money 🤣🤣
<HS> Others teams’ fans loath you , not because you’re a good player but because you’re a cheating whinging git. <CN> Shush 5-1 6-2 4-2
<HS> You are disgrace & should be ashamed of yourself! Englands worlds footballer & the reason that we lost! Leave the club for all please. <CN> Why should he be ashamed? Sort ur head out. Another keyboard warrior
<HS> TW: domestic assault Man United's footballer Mason Greenwood physically assaulted a woman. Football fans need to call him out on this. Hey just want you to know you're a horrible disgrace of a human being who's going to be spending the rest of your life in jail. <CN> Not another activist supporting the prision industry complex and not realising that the judicial incarnation system of surveillance, discipline and torture is violent par excellence .
<HS> REST IN PISS AND ROT IN JAIL <CN> are the reports even true?
<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> Why you burning your clothesline bruh
<HS> You won't be missed! Back at Shrewsbury before you know it, you little rat <CN> Brazy
<HS> Werner is not fast. Outpaced by 37 year old Ivanovic last season. He offers us NOTHING. All the prick does is run to the left side byline and cross it with no power into the first man. LEAVE <CN> das crazy but still doesnt change the fact that golddiger cost us 3 points👍🏾
<HS> Nah 💀💀💀💀💀 <CN> Hahahha first thing I thought of when I seen him 🤣🤣🤣
<HS> I want u out of my football club. Ur fucking sh1t man <CN> Are you okay?
<HS> Why does posting anything about his religion have to do with anything? This fanbase is a bit of a joke at this point. Let the man live, you pieces of shit! <CN> Is not just Man Utd fanbase, it's a human race thing
<HS> Shite u lad <CN> Leg it u
<HS> you fucking idiot go home your not good enough 👊😡😡 <CN> Stay away from Leeds. We don’t want you
<HS> When raped that woman and paid her to shut up, why did that not receive the same level of scrutiny, as #Greenwood has for battering his Mrs? Both are unequivocally absolutely deplorable, evil, vile and scum. Left these poor women scarred for life. <CN> They shouldn’t be allowed to buy their victims silence
<HS> if he plays football instead of being sentenced for this crime, i hope someone does to him what did to his cat/cats. absolutely abhorrent behaviour. <CN> Do what nani done to a fan 😂😂
<HS> Fuck <CN> Is he starting?
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> Celebrate like what? He hardly went mad did he?
<HS> You’re a cunt <CN> He definitely didn't write that reply. Not a single spelling error.
<HS> Absolute bollocks. Tired of reading this BS. <CN> They need to all get rid of social media.
<HS> Islam and Christianity are just but colonialism tools.Fake religions I better remain an Atheist. <CN> Religion in a nutshell, if it's going bad it's probably punishment or a test, if it's going good, it's blessings or prayer answered... Lol... Sounds like mental gymnastics to me
<HS> 7 counts of rape and 1 count of sexual assault, and yet gets to go home? Let that predator rot in a jail cell not a £5m mansion? Any average person facing those allegations wouldn’t see the light of day, disgusting and just plain wrong <CN> Can’t remember his sentence taking place as of yet, how often have we seen footballers charged with these crimes and proved innocent. Ronaldo’s went away quietly. Imagine all of this is false and he’s actually innocent. I don’t see it personally but he has no prior convictions
<HS> [BODY] Pudiger is shit <CN> [BODY] Werner and Pulisic terrorised yours to the point where they had to bounce out of Madrid, shameless
<HS> WAIT FOR 10 SLAG WAIT FOR TEN HAT FOUR MORE MOMTHS YOU SILLY GUY <CN> your heads gone😭😭
<HS> I think should voluntarily donate a months wages (£400k+) to be given 100 hours community service, and be banned from keeping pets. If you think he should go to prison for 5 years or be banned for life from football, you're an idiot. <CN> I think "idiot" is perhaps as much an overreaction as calling for those censures - I agree with your assessment though and I'm sure the Away crowds won't let this particular "sleeping cat"(pun) lie for a very long time either... 😂
<HS> Hahaha fuck off you <CN> Penalty fluffers of the world unite
<HS> This is the FIFA Club World Cup idiot. <CN> No one cares about that either
<HS> the words of a liar & animal abuser. You do not do that to something you love & cherish! I hope & the seek to prosecute you, take the cats away & make sure you are never able to have pets again! <CN> Sounds like a wife beater making excuses. They’re loved?? Strange way to show it. Like anyone who’s been caught on camera, they’re not sorry, they’re sorry they’ve been caught
<HS> this b!tch is shameless, imagine sharing the podium with someone for more than a decade and still being that bitter. He’s pushing 40 yet still acting like a child. That’s why you’re never going be the goat <CN> Says a bitch🤗
<HS> Just hit the most devious lick😈 cry bozo <CN> No bro 😩
<HS> Someone just sent me the full video. Disgusting. Hope you lose everything & are prosecuted. Hope that poor cat is with decent humans now. Bollocks to you too if you’re playing him tonight. Bollocks to football for now in fact if this is the case. <CN> I hope someone breaks his leg tonight
<HS> David moyes should be ashamed of himself tonight playing the disgusting cat kicker <CN> All he had to do was rest him for the game whilst decisions were made, it wasn't a high bar.

<HS> Absolute bag of shite If anyone thinks by having we’re gonna win titles then get your head from out of your arse! It’s a team effort and shouldn’t be on the shoulders of him. More than likely Chelsea,Man City or Liverpool would of beaten them comfortably <CN> Ignore I spoke to soon Vardys scored an OG 🙈🦊🦊🦊 X
<HS> No he is not. Most 10 year olds are sweet and can construct a sentence. This c*** is grown ass 45 year old incontinent bastard with a horrendous overbite. Nonce🙄🙄🙄 <CN> Nice case of libel there. Maybe wanna remove that tweet before I sue you?
<HS> How the fuck does this cunt actually think he went in fairly and got the ball? He literally gets away with shit like this every game! Fucking poes <CN> the ball went up his arse lol
<HS> Last man standing 😢, need to stunt on deez hoes <CN> last man standing?? bro there’s so many of us… we have a whole ass gc thats been going for about 4 yrs.

<HS> Shut up. You’re not a United fan <CN> I am bro
<HS> My I ask why coward, cat beater is playing tonight? <CN> Maybe the court of public opinion is the best place for him to be judged tonight. Heard he's getting roundly booed every time he touches the ball.
<HS> How can you “mix up” the absolutely unforgettable with anyone unless you are, at best, utterly, completely and totally useless ? <CN> He is useless, but he also has incriminating Photos of Boris with Arcuri i assume, hence he cannot be sacked
<HS> gwan reply to this tweet with a picture of ur goal then ye twerp <CN> Max he couldn’t score to because of the constant career ending tackles our excessively violent players were inflicting on him all the time. It’s a genuine miracle that he was able to walk off the pitch with the amount of damage taken by his body today
<HS> #HUNENG Hungary fans are absolutely disgusting, Throwing stuff at for scoring a goal? Scum. The reaction from the fans towards Sterling is just disgusting, No wonder they've been told to play behind closed doors for certain matches. <CN> Beats throwing at innocents in cafes eh.
<HS> Sick and vile <CN> Its Betis not Celtic you slow cretin
<HS> Sometimes it only takes one person from outside to destroy a beautiful love affair' Fuck Rafa the horrible cunt <CN> Digne isn’t premier league standard. Everton fans deluded yet again even though they have one of the best managers in the world.
<HS> I’m sick of bastards like you abusing animals, how dare you do that to an animal in your care, and laughing!!!

<HS> West Ham player filmed violently kicking his cat. Doesn’t he understand difference between a simple animal and a football? Horrible man should be prosecuted <CN> Animal violence is awful. Indefensible. Also a gateway to human violence. Immediately lock up animal violence offenders.

<HS> If your still angry that tried to force a move from Tottenham, then your within your rights to bare a grudge. However, if you ever doubted him, your a Cnut. ! #RealTalk <CN> Wasn't it sky sports trying to force the move ?
<HS> How!!!!!🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡 I don’t want to see you on the field again 😡😡😡 <CN> Who the fuck r u, u twat? Either Maguire or shaw needs to get that ball, it's not de gea's ball to get. And wat the fuck is he supposed to do when the guy takes a point blank shot at u? Also don't forget had it not been for de gea we'd b 6-0 in the fist half. So fuck off
<HS> Its so sad to see throwing his career away before it has barely begun What an idiot, keep it in your pants man! <CN> Check this P2E guys 😱😱😱 sooooo cool

<HS> One Hadith quotes Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as saying: “A good deed done to an animal is as meritorious as a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as an act of cruelty to a human being.” You're a Muslim. Have some shame scumbag . <CN> Didn't a prostitute during Jesus time all her sins forgiven and could enter paradise just because she fed a starving cat?
<HS> You're a cheat just like the rest of your team. Feigning injury, diving, play acting. Have you got no shame? Perhaps you're proud to be a blantent cheat. Wolves couldn't cope with Leeds so broke the game up by inventing injuries & ref was weak enough to let you get away with it. <CN> Fuck you Frank you twat, glad we see the back you scum when you are relegated come the end of the season.
<HS> What is wrong with you !! Why are you protecting for abusing women, and permanently suspending someone that thinks this is disgusting!!

<HS> Gabby Logan demands West Ham 'get rid of' Kurt Zouma after kicking pet cat 'for laughs' Well done ⁦ someone with decency unlike ⁦⁩ who should be sacked. ⁦ ⁦ you’re a disgrace <CN> Doubt its the first time he's done this which is why he was filmed
<HS> hope you know you were an absolute disgrace from start to finish, me pissing about on the ball to going straight down the tunnel after the game, we pay our hard earned money home and away every week and the least you could do is clap us away, absolutely pathetic <CN> One day Newcastle fans will realise that tagging the Newcastle owners and Newcastle players is extremely strange. Please for the love of god stop. It is not an achievement making Newcastle players delete their Twitter.
<HS> Messi is clear of you fraud🤡 <CN> Yes , Greatest Goalkeeper of all time.
<HS> Souness implications need looking at by you lot; he’s snidely saying did it on purpose, trying to break his leg. Sourness agenda needs to end or he needs binning for United games. It’s a foul, end of. Despicable person he is. #WOLMUN <CN> Absolutely spot on
<HS> [BODY] Do you understand stats. 2 new games is nowhere near 35+ games of a season that ended 2 months ago, foh you are like 12 years old. What a dumbass <CN> [BODY] Once again, that doesn’t change the fact Greenwood is currently in better form
<HS> You fool. “ I’m confident we will win “ Complacent, Arrogant and disrespectful to our opponents <CN> Hahahaha you still chatting shite you absolute weapon. You calling anyone arrogant is hilarious pal. Get in the bin 👍

<HS> It starts by abusing animals, then it progresses to human. is a scumbag. That is all. <CN> Facts

But you know, success/failure by association rules the lives of the insignificant, it seems. <CN> Ah thanks mate! We will try to enjoy drinking your tears of bitterness. Mmmmmmm
<HS> I am extremely happy for All he did was went to see his sick mother and returned late. 's father was sick, SAF told him to go for as long as he wanted. What Arteta is telling us is that Arsenal is more important than family. ARTETA IS A DESPICABLE HUMAN BEING😡💔 <CN> You're getting it wrong. Read all the news before tweeting.
<HS> We don’t want your words we want your performances. Shut up until we get that <CN> And we dont want your support you mug

<HS> Have you seen this sickening footage of kicking and abusing his defenceless cat.🤬😡 <CN> #jailzouma #ZoumaOut #zouma It’s time these cowards and bullies were brought to justice - we can do it privately if you are too busy investigating ?
<HS> I hope whoever scores against us next cups his ear and does a knee slide. What a shameless player, disgrace of a captain <CN> Wish we had Leicester City. Vardy would’ve definitely done that. Banter king!
<HS> Diving cunt.... <CN> Lmao your embarassing

<HS> how you're a professional footballer is beyond me, fuck off with rafa you bag of shite <CN> Keane isn’t good enough, but being personal isn’t the one, the man suffers with anxiety and depression. He’ll know he’s not playing good enough, don’t need Twitter tagging him in posts going in on him, he’s not doing it deliberately.
<HS> you are sick: do you do that to your kids? For fun ? What a freak you are. I hope you will be prosecuted and sent away <CN> Will you fire this lunatic ?? I hope never to see you again on a pitch. You are a horror - inhuman behavior

He’s not even top 10 best ever cbs just yet and probably won’t make the cut. Pool will go downhill now because of no invest
<HS> funny how none of those serial winners play for him because roma is shit💀💀 <CN> Right 😭 clear of puke Shaw btw
<HS> Absolute bag of shite If anyone thinks by having we’re gonna win titles then get your head from out of your arse! It’s a team effort and shouldn’t be on the shoulders of him. More than likely Chelsea,Man City or Liverpool would of beaten them comfortably <CN> That was the same way of thinking of Juventus' supporters. They thought he was the super hero who allowed us to win the Champions League. I mean, wtf?!? The key is the team, not a single person!!!

<HS> Shame on you <CN> He’s stayed with this club till age 29. He should’ve been sold in the summer and the club refused to let him go. We have a terrible problem of overvaluing our players. He was also promised game time and is getting none.
<HS> Fuck off Atkinson! Denied us 2 clear penalties and gave one to West Ham that was clearly not a pen! to the rescue! <CN> Nah it was a pen, however shouldn’t have happened in the first place after the stonewaller for Ron 30 seconds before

Every bloody time ! What a pathetic man.. you’ve just lost everything! <CN> Totally vile excuse for a man. Another example of how people feel money gives them control and power over others. What they have has corrupted their morals.

Absolute twat of a player and for playing for a big club like Man U! Hope mason’s gf gets justice! Scum as always 💩 <CN> Harriet, the names Harriet. Calling her Masons “anything” is just weird.

We love you 💙 <CN> For context Pogba put a picture of him praying on Instagram and had to remove it becuase of abuse, this fanbase disgusts me there a cancer to Manchester United and it needs kicking out permanently
<HS> DISGUSTING and VILE from if allegations are true. There is simply no place for that behaviour and treatment of people in this world. Would be quite happy for him to see the inside of a prison cell while he watches his career fall in tatters. #masongreenwood <CN> No matter what happens, Mason Greenwood still remains my starboy 😭😭 Just a pathetic situation
<HS> In football it's all about winning you idiot lol He is a striker he isn't supposed to play for the team he is their to get goals and that is it😆 He has achieved more than any other footballer in history that is facts! <CN> Messi has achieved more than him

<HS> Small shit club <CN> This ratio is bigger than your club
<HS> Hey, why do you continue to pay Graham Souness a salary just for him to bully ? You'd swear he was personally assaulted by him. Useless, angry, old prick. #WOLMUN <CN> It is psychotic stuff now like

<HS> I think its disgusting how is getting treated by that fat f**k <CN> It's no secret we love Rafa up here, but I think a lot of people fail to realise just how much of an ego he actually has, and how he manages to fall out with quite a lot of people over the years. Could be wrong but I I had to guess I'd say Digne could be the innocent one here.
<HS> Chief whingebag <CN> Its caragher’s smile for me

<HS> First of many lighters thrown at by people who don't deserve to go to football matches. This isn't a Spurs problem, it's a shitty people problem. I hope they get lifetime bans. Sort yourselves out you idiots. <CN> Love the reaction from Bergwijn who gives Rudiger the look that says, " why you making it a big deal, just forget it" instead of turning to his own fans...
<HS> Hashtag jlings… fuck off tou sack of piss! <CN> Being a keyboard warrior I see, we don't need no haters. Be happy for a young man inspiring a generation
<HS> The problem here is NOT , or and FSG but Mo's snake of an agent, imo <CN> Shades of Bobby Duncan about this albeit on a different level, but the premise is the same. Greedy Agent with one agenda which doesn’t necessarily include what’s entirely best for his client. Whatever happened with Duncan and his Agent. Does anybody know?……. Hmmm 🤨
<HS> This is and 's whole game. Always selfishly detrimentally playing for their own stats and sabotaging the team as opposed to playing for the team like a team player. They'll ge their g/a against shit team but at what cost? Absolute garbage players <CN> This!!! But they are not ready for this conversation
<HS> Anyone defending unfollpw me or ya getting the 🚫! How ANY ONE can defend this two bit trailer trash spunk hustler is beyond me!!! <CN> Shocking what he’s done and the recording is wow sick

<HS> Complete bollocks….why is he taking about racism? The question was in relation to his team mate volleying his cat…… you daft bastard ! <CN> Kicking cats. Racism. Both obviously wrong. Both should be condemned and addressed. It’s not a defence saying this bad thing isn’t as bad as that bad thing so that makes everything ok 🤷🏻‍♂️
<HS> Practicing my booing and rude gestures. Ready for you rat boy <CN> Gonna start now thanks for the reminder

You need your legs breaking you cunt <CN> i guess your legs should be broken too for anything you might have done in the past then? people make mistakes, where was your outrage for all the things other PL players have done? not defending his comment but this is a ridiculous comment, keep it quiet over there!
<HS> Fuck 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾 <CN> Wait for Cr7 bro

<HS> Ronaldo is actually a sad little pathetic human being just like fans. Finished player liking posts slandering messi, bitch messi owns #7 now. Getting benched against league leaders wasn't enough to be embarrassed about I guess. Keep crying finished bozo🤡 <CN> You wish your goat is a scam robbed good players twice
<HS> Please don't look at this if you're upset by the abuse of cats and other animals. Prosecution and jail for this scum. <CN> I am so sorry but by your actions you have ruined your life and the life of your family. You have attacked a companion spirit animal and lowered your vibration. You have invited the Ugly Spirit into your house.
<HS> You're just a shit Benny Blanco. <CN> Scenes when Benny cracks one from 30 yards away
<HS> On a day where my dog had a third seizure in a matter of weeks and only getting 4 hours sleep as a result. Sitting with him for 1 hour worrying sick as he came back with it. Helped pay for him to have 2 major surgeries on his back with my parents. Fuck you you cunt <CN> When I read about it, I thought maybe he just pushed the cat out the way. After watching it and seeing how he drop kicked a cat. Disgraceful. Any normal person would lose their pets and face criminal punishment
<HS> People saying innocent till proven guilty. She took pictures and literal audio recordings of Greenwood assaulting her. is a violent rapist and needs to fuck off behind bars. <CN> Fits right into United now
<HS> N0nce <CN> Better then you ever will be.
<HS> I have a bigger dick than you bozo <CN> Where's the pic?
<HS> Good riddance! You're a freeloader. As if it could be any more disgraced, a stain on the shirt. It's because of the likes of you that this Club is in the mess it's in. Not only, but very much symptomatic. You won't be missed. <CN> You really must be a miserable fool to post something like this. No! It's not because of Willian that the club is in a mess. It's because of haters like yourself dragging our players confidence down by abusing them.
<HS> Get yourself out of Manchester United , you’re not bigger than the club, if you can’t admit that you have been trash for 2 years without improving, then you must be delusional, OLE pampered you, we all saw it. You silly ass epistles can’t save you anymore. <CN> Anyhow player.
<HS> fat ass <CN> That guy is the biggest fucking opp in the world I swear
<HS> In full support of Harriet.. should be kicked out of and go straight to jail. He is absolutely digusting. <CN> Well said, its a mystery to me what even attracted her to the multi millionaire Mason Greenwood in the first place?

Give James Tomkins a great reception when he comes back but he assaulted a policeman, but whatever you do don’t kick a cat or our fans will want you out
<HS> I’ve got to be honest, I shouldn’t but I base my opinion of Ole on his treatment of . If he was my manager and I was Donny Inwoikd absolutely despise him. <CN> I wouldn't be surprised if he does 🙁

<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> So it’s ok for people to shout abuse to the players during the game but as soon as the opposition scores a score and celebrates in front of them it’s okay to throw a bottle? Righttttt.
<HS> Quiet you old dusty rat… my English isn’t bad for a second language + auto correct…Sinclair is crap though get over it…she’s not even fun to watch.

So are you saying its OK for black people to abuse animals????? Knobhead!! <CN> It was a relay to what Chris Kirkland said about kicking a cat worse than racism.

<HS> Dear players, you know what to do to that lowlife scum Give him the same treatment Emre got...plus some. 👊🏼 <CN> Wasn't Watfords greatest ever player a thug that stamped on somebodys head and went to prison? (Deeney) Didn't they employ Martin Taylor after he went out to break Eduardos ankle? On the basis of that are Watford a 'thuggish' club? Luton are more a family club than Watford. Thugs
<HS> Loving 1st we get Hoddle sucking up to Scoles over Le Tiss 2nd we get presenters saying Hasenhuttl would be a lovely fit for ManU Waiting for them to say would be great them. Fuck off with your bias bullshit. So annoying #SaintsFC <CN> Ian Darke and Martin Keown. As the game progressed they got more and more disappointed that United weren't out of sight. Only by the second half were they begrudging Southampton's pressing. What is it about this weird attitude amongst the broadcasters?
<HS> Anthony Taylor is a criminal <CN> And has to be persecuted
<HS> Landed in our car soft shite. <CN> Said to my little lad I hope someone got off win that ball!! ⚽💪🏻
<HS> Despite the fact that plays for my club & could have been a legend for us, f*ck ya & ya cat kicking high jinks. No excuses. Zero point saying sack ya or sell ya cos some other club will take ya. How about pledge to fund a centre for life? <CN> Absolutely awful thing to do. What an earth was he thinking. It's all very well apologizing for it, but why do it in the first place. Poor poor cat. I sincerely hope it's ok and finds a nicer home.

<HS> Please take the cats away immediately they are not safe #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> Why! Are you looking for proof for goodness sake. There’s no need for the ‘coy’ response. Could be that your funding will be affected if nothing is done about this cruelty, or maybe you don’t want to be bothered to spend your money on what appears to be an open and shut case.
<HS> Load of bullshit. Next time save your fingers and type, 'we're shit, but we're trying to be less shit" <CN> At least your players say something,, our spurs shits just hide till they win a game
<HS> It’s no surprise someone with this mentality would feel threatened by the arrival of Ronaldo. If you’re complaining about the demands BEFORE Ronaldo, you’ll never survive alongside him. Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <CN> "The 4-time relegated Manchester United captain, , is yet to be convinced of Chris Almas' pedigree". You fraud.

You are a vile human being nothing clever about what you did just shows people what you are all about. The list keeps coming with these tossers <CN> Most footballers are decent people, they just live in a gilded world. Players at the club I follow do loads of work in the community, most of it unpublicised . It’s not their fault that someone is willing to pay ridiculous money for their skills.
<HS> On behalf of all Kurts go fuck yourself <CN> How does a person decided to just drop kick their cat. Seriously. What a dickhead

<HS> How does this twat get airtime , literally kills him to praise #LFC and … do you yourself a favour and fuck off will ye soft lad <CN> The fact he can’t even back up his opinion with facts/stats says it all. Utd fan though so what do you expect
<HS> you’re making the baggies look like right twats💙 <CN> tbf he did that when he was playing for us, couldnt hit a barn door from a yard away. Fair play its clicked with you in a way it never did for us. You wouldnt recognise him as the same player.

<HS> Cow <CN> President no man

<HS> I think has one thing going bad for him, which is his agent. This clown should be fired. <CN> Definitely 🙄he's an idiot
<HS> If this is true then Greenwood’s contract should be terminated and released from the club. I could never celebrate or support an abuser. I feel for his girlfriend, I hope she is able to heal after this. Really hope this isn’t true but I’m fucking disgusted in . 😔 <CN> All the evidence is there. Only his age will save his career but he's done at united

<HS> Fuck off with this. Tired of hearing all this bullshit from you lot every fucking week. How have you not learned to come off your line yet? <CN> We literally have one professional, decent, committed player on our roster and it's DDG. He's been our best player consistently for a decade, with the odd wobble and all you do is attack him. Give off.
<HS> Moron, I am a season ticket holder, not stupid sick sad boy like you. Being a member of an official membership club means you take part in fans participation of clubs. <CN> If you're a ticket holder then I'm a United board member + I'm not stupid, sick or sad😭😭😂 you jobless idiot

<HS> I hate depression....x <CN> Big respect and love to you... My DMs are open if you want to talk...
<HS> First of many lighters thrown at by people who don't deserve to go to football matches. This isn't a Spurs problem, it's a shitty people problem. I hope they get lifetime bans. Sort yourselves out you idiots. <CN> Must be pointed out, Steven Bergwijn is embarrassing himself wanting Rudiger to basically ignore it and get on with the match.
<HS> Useless player. <CN> This man is also club captain
<HS> Flop is ole, penaldo n ManU.. losers in this order <CN> Saul is going to flop. Won't keep up with the intensity of the PL.

<HS> And the cheeky prick is “considering his future and not happy not in the starting 11” get to fuck Up there with the worst performance I’ve ever seen and the worst refereeing performance I’ve ever seen <CN> Bruno and Ronaldo don’t need to play at the same time. Bruno had no business starting today over pogba. My god!!!! Harry is terrible straight terrible. He needs to leave this summer!!!! Rashford I’m speechless. Game we clearly should of won. Hey it is what it is
<HS> New balance👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 <CN> Better than being jobless and havin "no balance" like you

<HS> The Giants of Africa always have the last laugh, cry b*tch <CN> mahrez clear of all your washed players
<HS> Another footballer who appears to be a lowlife piece of shit! If this is you , hopefully do the right thing a sack you but hold your registration so you can’t sign for anyone else. Absolutely disgraceful. <CN> I used to live with (house share) with an African dude from Gabon, the views he had on animal treatment (amoungst other things) were vastly different to what I'd call normal views in the UK. I think he was as shocked by our treatment of animals as we were if his views on it!
<HS> fuck u <CN> Fuck you(1)

<HS> Hey You are a damn psychopath. Who does this kind of thing anyway? Seek help. 🙄 <CN> MF's been fired, fined, and his TWO cats confiscated by RSPCA for "observation" -- has petition if you want to sign. It's for firing him, but we still could use all the outrage we can get so this rat bastard knows just how much his act is hated.
<HS> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you cunt <CN> Yes geez 😂😂😂😂😂😂
<HS> Any company that sponsors moving forward can go to hell as far as i’m concerned. Shouldn’t ever have another club but he will because some clubs have zero morals. <CN> Think what is trying to say is all contracts/sponsors should be withdrawn/paused if you like, until we know the facts!! I think He should be locked up and the key thrown away!!

This whole "let's see how it unfolds, there's two sides to a story , let's see IF he is actually guilty,is enough to make me sick

<HS> Why tf are you still here then? Put in a transfer request and leave if you're not a greedy coward. <CN> I don't think many understand how toxic david de gea is both on and off the feild.
<HS> Really really despise 🤮🤮🤮🤮 sling it <CN> Green and yellow scarf back out pal?
<HS> Just a shit Declan Rice <CN> Why would you @ the player you know the club are looking at buying with this sort of comment.
<HS> Get in there you cunts!!!!! Should of had a pen our selfs cheating bastards! groooovvvvyyyy 🕺 <CN> VAR are against us we love itttttt 😍
<HS> Seeing as no one else is willing to say it, I will. Get out my club . You’re not good enough. Fans chant your name out of pity and nothing more. Fraud. <CN> Where is this for half the other players today? Werner did more in this game than lukaku has done in the last 2.
<HS> When i saw on the team sheet i knew he would make an impact! He's Reece James, b*tch! #ARSCFC <CN> Love that guy.
<HS> how can you defend scum by saying he’s made a mistake and should be forgiven! So you’re saying drop kicking a cat is just a mistake and he should be forgiven, if he was drop kicking a human you wouldn’t be saying the same thing! You’re a coward like him! <CN> Shut up with ur boring nonsense and get a life!!
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> You are the one thats is stupid, why can’t you appoint yourself as team manager biscuit bone 🍖
<HS> Naughty <CN> Receiving lessons from Matip I see
<HS> Get the fuck out of my club <CN> 🤣🤣 can’t wait to see this tweet for another 6 months til summer
<HS> Hey, , why not try that with someone your own size, you fucking scumbga coward? - sack him. - if he doesn't want the cat, I will gladly give it a good home. #sackzouma <CN> Total abhorrent cruelty in front of a child too ! and the *****r filming needs ……🥊
<HS> Absolutely disgusting behaviour. What a prick <CN> This man is crazy or mad ! The cat should be removed from him with an interdiction to get one for the rest of his life. And what about his child/ children ?🤬🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮🐾🐾🍀🍀
<HS> You know what Jesse? Take yourself and your dabbing French fuckwit friend and get the fuck out of the club that stood by you as you drove the fanbase to sleep with your dross performances for well over 4 seasons before you were shipped to the bubble blowers... <CN> You're having a fucking laugh if you think this joke of a fanbase has shown him anything other than disrespect for the entire time he's been here
<HS> Anyone who abuses animals to deserve incur the abuse and then some Of course this piece of scum is a BLM supporter, pretends to have a higher moral compass than others Naturally, there will be a sports media blackout on this story as well <CN> Of course won't be investigating, they only get off their asses if someone sends mean tweets I really hope launches a major pressure campaign against , this is so unacceptable
<HS> Think it’s poor some fans startin to turn on mind, been a rare speckle of glitter in an absolute pile of dog shit. Could drop Messi in this squad and he’d still look average at times. Clubs on its arse from 14 years of Ashley nowt else, don’t forget that. #NUFC <CN> Some of our fans are horrendous
<HS> Just watching MOTD you big lump of shit…. You are fucking dreadful … One of the worst defenders to play for #ManchesterUnited and the worse captain in our history. <CN> OMG 😭😭😭😭

<HS> Someone just sent me the full video. Disgusting. Hope you lose everything & are prosecuted. Hope that poor cat is with decent humans now. Bollocks to you too if you’re playing him tonight. Bollocks to football for now in fact if this is the case. <CN> Animal abuse is so low 😭 utter scum
<HS> Yep. Still a disgrace to our club. <CN> Says the kid who's never watched a game in his life.
<HS> I am not with you <CN> Idk why everyone is riled up as a professional what he did was unacceptable if you want to leave, leave Ppl need to understand no matter what they think football is it’s a fuckingbusiness and somethings hv consequences I would hv even found a way to sue his ass I were in charge
<HS> What a disgusting scumbag (and his brother who filmed him) abusing a pet cat by repeatedly kicking it like a football & slapping it whilst laughing & encouraging a child to join in like it was a game with an object. Shame on you <CN> What goes around comes around and there is a hell of a lot coming Zouma's way. He's already had to step up security. There is not enough security in the world for those who are now targeting him. Most of them have police and other security in their pockets.
<HS> SHUT THE FUCK UP, IDOLO 👍👍 <CN> Shut this Ratio up.
<HS> And this my fellow humans is a prime example of the utterly vile people that we are inflicted with in a daily basis. I would hope that someone kicks the living 💩 out of this excuse of a human being. you are a disgrace to humanity. <CN> And the Met Police decide not to investigate the incident?? It’s a damning indictment of society how these footballers are heroes to millions…
<HS> pass the fkn ball you greedy c*nt get out of my club #NUFC <CN> Seek help Bob. You're a sick man. An embarrassment to humanity. Grow up.
<HS> Shut up fool <CN> Dude what’s wrong with you? This isn’t how you treat a club legend.
<HS> personally i’m sick of you <CN> i love you more
<HS> Tw <CN> This is definitely the King's new suit of clothes. All the woke yes people clamoring to praise his originality. Women of the future are going to choose celibacy at this rate. WTF is happening to a large amount of young men?
<HS> Sex education is too sick I recommend it <CN> You look like Eric
<HS> 0 asks bozo 😹 <CN> Belter gonna show the wife la😹😹😹
<HS> Get out my club you’re shit <CN> Willyyyyyyyy

<HS> wish me happy new year then, selfish pig <CN> Hope he siiu’s your tweet
<HS> I wish would fuck off back to Chelsea <CN> But yet he completed more passes (55) and more attacking third passes (15). He also made more tackles (6) and made more ball recoveries (10) than any other player against Crystal Palace.

<HS> Nothing infuriates me more than cruelty to innocent animals. you are a vile human being. <CN> Sickening stuff. Hard to not leave that video not angry.
<HS> Why does posting anything about his religion have to do with anything? This fanbase is a bit of a joke at this point. Let the man live, you pieces of shit! <CN> Some footballers aren't allowed to have a personal life in 2022...😔
<HS> That’s how you treat women you fucking dick <CN> How do you make this about one of your own players😭
<HS> [BODY] this is why doesn’t take the knee. It’s not changing, it won’t till you start coming down hard on these animals <CN> [BODY] It's ironic that the person most racist use as their reason for not taking the knee... is being racially abused.
<HS> You are shit <CN> Ratio then
<HS> Hey does this qualify as a "Thunderbastard"? you have a huge future ahead of you. Keep it up! <CN> Indeed it does. Lovely cannon off the crossbar.

<HS> Bam! Right in the… oh… the upper chest? That’s strange, ⁦⁩ , you were all like, “Oh, my face, my face; I think my jaw’s broken.” That’s called cheating by those of us in the non-cheating world. But you wouldn’t know about that because you’re a cheat. <CN> What a joke. Never been a conspiracy nut but this is that match is starting to turn me.
<HS> you're a failure and a disability in the United team Please quit <CN> When you get to be a Man Utd player He might listen to your opinion until then keep up the pathetic hate towards HM if it makes you happy he doesn’t care a toss what you think anyway 😂
<HS> I won’t watch the video of the little b**** kicking his cat, because it’ll stay with me for ages. I cannot tolerate cruelty to animals, and who the f*** does this to their own pet?! That animal sees you as their protector, they don’t know why the sudden violence… <CN> …is happening toward them, especially from the person who is supposed to care for them the most. , can I use your massive ugly head to practice penalties with? Scumbag c***, lock him up and have the inmates beat him daily, please.
<HS> Our fanbase are an absolute DISGRACE!!! Don’t try tell me Paul Pogba gets ‘fair’ treatment from some of you pussies!!!! Had to remove a picture of him praying cos of abuse by his own fan base!!

<HS> Thanks for destroying the club Shame and spit on your name <CN> Mata? Mctominey? Seriously mate, I’d consider getting behind them rather than “spitting” on their name… spitting. Dude, that’s just disgusting

<HS> You Are Just a Shit Tom Daley <CN> Tom Daley does Olympic diving mate not football and jack grealish does football not Olympic diving mate
<HS> When is on the pitch. He takes penalties. End of. Auba is 💩 at them!!!!!! And how was Danny Rose allowed to complete that game today with zero red cards!?! Absolute joke one rule for one rule for against Arsenal hey scum bags <CN> Just knew he would miss and like the keeper knew where he would put it! Annoying see Laca taken off again as well
<HS> Fuck you <CN> DISRESPECTFULLY
<HS> I never once called you a dickhead actually. I called you many things but not that. You insulted people first and got upset once others started saying things to you. If you cant take the insults, dont dish them out. Its as simple as that <CN> No I'm not getting upset you are not getting the point are you because you're too stupid
<HS> How can you “mix up” the absolutely unforgettable with anyone unless you are, at best, utterly, completely and totally useless ? <CN> There's a displeasing answer to this... but "yes" for now will do. Can I just point out that meeting Mario Otoje would be absolutely unforgettable for many too. Have you seen him play? Best 2nd row in the world or thereabouts. It's not all about football.
<HS> GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY <CN> Along with , ,
<HS> If Mason Greenwood had done that to my daughter you would be seeing his picture everywhere you looked with the word MISSING next to it because I’d move heaven and earth to get revenge. Horrible little scumbag. <CN> Her da couldn’t be less bothered by her ordeal and more about the person he thought he was. Assholes the pair of them

<HS> the only time u wear the badge is in training fuck off <CN> Terrible supporter. You don't even qualify as a fickle fan. Easy block.

<HS> What the fuck man!! Fucking scumbag <CN> That's how you spot psychopath WIFE BEATERS. KUNT.

<HS> I Think should donate at LEAST a months wages to an animal charity - Then work at LEAST 100 hours for that charity #Shameful #Coward <CN> Only sorry cause he got caught and his career’s on the line.
<HS> Sick dirty scumbag <CN> Kinda racist like Ik you don’t like black people but this is appalling behaviour
<HS> The most useless football player in history <CN> He’s not a footballer from the beginning.
<HS> Strike this abusive bastard off, there is no reason for this disgusting abuse of a defenceless animal under any circumstances. Setting this example to those children and followers is absolutely not acceptable, no words for this scum <CN> What a total scum bag that cat will be traumatised now, I watched the second half and Zouma was getting booed by his own supporters as well, must have thick skin! W⚓😠
<HS> Just a shit Jack Grealish. Hope you catch Covid <CN> he earns more in the time you sent this tweet as you do in a year 💀💀
<HS> So it’s ok for to have a player who abuses animals is it. For him to be broadcasted every week to the nation knowing what he does to innocent animals in his home. Cat lives with its abuser you piece of shit bully <CN> Absolutely scum, low, disgusting human being. condemning????? Not absolutely demanding an abuser is not broadcasted on tv every week? Have you even bothered to take further steps cor the well-being of the cat, or is that decision up to its abuser? Absolutely disgusting
<HS> playing football for a big team like #MUFC is not for people like you. You are a disgrace and need to leave our club. You are the worst player I ever see who got lot of chances and still at 28y/o hasn't shown anything above average. I don't like you and never will. <CN> You’re a big fool for this post. asshole🖕🏾
<HS> How!!!!!🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡 I don’t want to see you on the field again 😡😡😡 <CN> Who are you referring to? If it’s de gea your cracked off your mind but if it’s Shaw and Maguire then you have every right to be upset at them since Shaw should’ve kicked the ball away
<HS> We support you that fat twat will be gone soon mate and you will be happy again <CN> He’s been rubbish so why not drop him. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
<HS> Oh fuck off. He can’t catch a break. Hurry back lad <CN> It’s such a shame, injuries have truly wrecked his time with us.

<HS> #Catslivesmatter you evil man. You are a coward by abusing a defenceless animal is totality inexcusable and for the twat that filmed it I have no words. I expect you to at least give a month’s salary to an animal charity and I hope the take action. <CN> I hope the do - Teach others a lesson
<HS> Ur life must be shit <CN> YoUr LiFe MuSt Be ShIt!!!
<HS> [BODY] If you want to pretend you an uncle that takes young boys virginity’s mate I’d probably keep that to yourself <CN> [BODY] If want to pretend that your uncle didn't take your virginity then that's fine too

<HS> Loserpool to the world <CN> If it helps you sleep better at night Anyway first beat young boys
<HS> It is disgusting to watch what you did to an innocent animal <CN> Yeah, not a man that kicks innocent animals. He needs to rot!
<HS> He’s a fooking rapist too !!! Has the money to pay off the girl/girls. Sets a fantastic example his children and other young children. <CN> The document about Cristiano Ronaldo. "she said no" is fabricated. Kathryn fraud Mayorga was never raped. She didn't tell the Police his name or where it happened.
<HS> What a disgusting shit human being is! Should not be allowed to be a professional football player! #SackGreenwood #HarrietRobson <CN> Must be something about that number 11 shirt 😬😬
<HS> How many times is this useless bastard gonna cost us a goal, it's the biggest scam in football history that he's here at this club, starting & captaining this side. FUCK YOU OLE GLAZER <CN> He's trash.
<HS> I’m hearing the scumbag is a patron of a lion sanctuary? I suggest if he ever wants to play football in this country again he goes into the sanctuary and volleys a fully grown lion? Then I will forgive him <CN> I agree gone right off him kicking a little cat
<HS> awww you okay mate? wankerrrrr. keep crying <CN> absolute definition of twat

Anyone could do that if you all start casting your stones against him without even listening to him then you're a bunch of asswipes and should be used to wipe my black ass <CN> Im already hearing people say hope he rots or dies in jail thats fucked up but i cant see how this can be fake
<HS> Shame? <CN> He has no shame as he has his workers defending him on Twitter around the clock
<HS> Tw <CN> Your typical lefty fruitloop PRICK...😜🤦‍♂️🙄

<HS> Shame on you Greenwood, please out from Manchester United <CN> Out of United? Out of football! Into prison
<HS> [BODY] What’s this elitist bullshit. Piss off <CN> [BODY] It isn't elitist, it's realty.

<HS> Fuck yoy <CN> You
<HS> We watched 30secs of abusing his cats, it would have been for a lot longer. He actually got his child to help him! It wasn't the first time, you liar! Says a lot about Zouma and his family if this is their entertainment. Evil, sick 🤬 Hope karma hits you hard! <CN> And no punishment
<HS> your a fucking disgrace. 70 million for you to stand around like a fucking melon! Get out of my club. You waste of skin you meaty cunt. <CN> You clearly have no clue what you on about. Did you watch harry in the euros?, he was our best player, pogba and Ronaldo must leave they are the problem
<HS> Didn’t the prick say was fit to play? #avfc Morgan come tell us the truth. Hopefully the useless bastard will be sacked soon. Smithout <CN> I’d like to hear from too, should never have been treated badly by Smith
<HS> Any company that sponsors moving forward can go to hell as far as i’m concerned. Shouldn’t ever have another club but he will because some clubs have zero morals. <CN> the problem is when you are paid so much money from a young age with no proper education on how to behave, and no-one around you saying no they think they are untouchable
<HS> Pack your bags whilst you’re at it fucking useless cunt <CN> He’s your best player
<HS> So David Moyes (the so called animal lover) thinks needs support for abusing defenceless animals whilst laughing! are you sick! Why does he need support for enjoying inflicting pain? You should all be ashamed of yourselves! Don’t give a 💩 about the cat do you <CN> #Zouma is a Serial Killer, like this dude ⬇️
<HS> Eyup get waltzing darn that tunnel ya dirty bastard <CN> In at him then
<HS> I M P A C T 🤝 <CN> Sell Adama to Liverpool we need him🙏❤️
<HS> A sublime finish from for at but rather than giving Raz due credit the emphasis is all placed on poor defending - pathetic, but predictable commentary. You’d think Andy Hinchcliffe was a 5x Ballon d’Or winner - he’s a snide shite🤬 <CN> Commentary is unreal " It's a pity a big moment didn't fall to Norwich before the goal" biased beyond belief.. Jamie Redknapp backing us.. Hinchcliffe is a disgrace.
<HS> We don’t deserve u Harry <CN> We should of sold him at when he was at his peak at 150 mil and then rebuilt the squad
<HS> 7PM and we out here assisting on CL nights, what are you doing ? sleeping like a d|ckhead, D|CKHEAD . <CN> Cringeee
<HS> just put in the transfer request bozo <CN> I hope he does it ASAP
<HS> Shut your mouth <CN> Suck my balls like u mom do
<HS> We’re getting ucl before u hold datt😹😹👎👎 <CN> Auba is one of us you clown. Gunner forever
<HS> Get. To. fuck. <CN> Do they not realise this is annoying as fuck?
<HS> How can you “mix up” the absolutely unforgettable with anyone unless you are, at best, utterly, completely and totally useless ? <CN> I think you just answered your own question ...
<HS> Small break wey dem give dis nigga He don de follow kpekus No calm down Come de play shit <CN> His wife guy
<HS> Cry baby <CN> Stop it he's always a gooner
<HS> GOD go punish you you are a fool a useless fool <CN> Relax bro it's only football fam I get ur passion for the team But it's football fam there must be a winner and a looser but there is always the next cup Don't let it effect u as a person Plus iwobi is a good player bro Just didn't set the world a light like he was ment to
<HS> Fuck off Lingard. Have you ran out of photos to post of yourself in your West Ham kit? <CN> Yeeee
<HS> #Rangnick is one man. And still turns like a fat cunt stuck in a phone box. Calm the fuck down and let's just see how it goes. #mufc <CN> I've seen stena Ferry's turn quicker than Maguire 🤷‍♂️
<HS> Snake <CN> Sean, this ain’t like you mate...
<HS> Not even a thank you or goodbye post you little rat. You left the best club and manager itw to join a UEL debt team because they used to be good and have a big stadium. Well done for ruining your career aged 21 <CN> He'll probably release one later on mate. We don't know the reasons why he left. If it's for footballing reasons then he made a mistake but maybe he was homesick, who knows. Barca are not great right now but they got some good young players coming through the ranks. He'll be fine
<HS> That guy is a brainwashed nut job, he has no clue <CN> Do you
<HS> Nobody wants to hear your fucking waffle pal. 2 years of this. Shut up and focus on not dropping a disasterclass every single game. Hope this helps <CN> Mike i am your biggest fan
<HS> Your surely the biggest whinge bag on the planet <CN> Klopp is just as bad as this fella haha
<HS> Landed in our car soft shite. <CN> After all the times I’ve got tha kid to mind me ball for me an tha one time he gets one an won’t even let me have a sniff, Little bastard 😂
<HS> These are the type of players that we want out of the club immediately.. You're a disgrace <CN> Mans got such an ego having problems with not starting games for Manchester United, bro your not good enough to start games for us.
<HS> Fella, when I was 7 my coach told me, “Hold the line and dont open spaces” YOU an 80M player do the contrary. With all respect, Fuck off and get out of my club. #MUFC #ManchesterUnited <CN> I coach U9 football and rugby. Day 1 Button your lip and open your ears, play the whistle. Day 2 Hold your line.
<HS> Shut up <CN> Leave my man alone
<HS> Hopefully someone will boot across the floor like he seems to enjoy doing to defenceless animals <CN> The people recording, laughing and just allowing him to do this are just as bad.
<HS> Just shouldn't have answered this you fraud <CN> Why
<HS> Jack grealish proper fraud stop paying football mate cos u a whole fraud 👍 <CN> Well done mate great tweet. Nobody cared
<HS> Idiot, if you were not a brainless being you will by now realise how stupid your action was...Being on twitter early to talk shit to players and clubs you don't support just speak to ur personal insecurity and how useless you are.... <CN> Stfu you maggot. Don't you have a job to do? A girlfriend to attend to? Children to feed? I'm just talking facts because I know that Chelsea and its fanbase are finished+ clueless like you.

<HS> Are you stupid? <CN> Honestly that’s the only question
<HS> 😡😡 <CN> Where is the security? Not only players need to shows some respect but same goes for the fan as well, clearly he can see that he's in the middle of interviews, why he doing it! Was it in purpose? Mmmmmm...

<HS> Think it’s poor some fans startin to turn on mind, been a rare speckle of glitter in an absolute pile of dog shit. Could drop Messi in this squad and he’d still look average at times. Clubs on its arse from 14 years of Ashley nowt else, don’t forget that. #NUFC <CN> They have to see the bigger picture but a lot can't!
<HS> Well we have one suggestion for you all... Fcuk off. If you don't want to be lead by and match the standards of the world's best ever player and legend then close the door on your way out! , , , 🖕🏻🖕🏻 <CN> Don't you look silly Gerard? I wouldn't believe everything you read in twitter and also, the world isn't flat and the covid vaccination doesn't have a 5G chip in it 🤣🤣🤣
<HS> Don't care the amount of children you feed, you're a piece of shit on the football pitch #MUNATL #MUFC <CN> Ahn ahn, slow down boss.
<HS> Let's get this straight. Maguire is shite. And not worthy of bring utd captain. Phil Jones > faguire <CN> *Being

<HS> Pure cretin <CN> My heart cries watching this shit. I really hope he won't be playing pro football ever again after that.
<HS> Just seen the pictures and heard the audio. What a fucking piece of shit you are . On the pitch you’re not even good enough to lace Ronaldo’s boots. You’ve been a shithouse there and you’ve been a shithouse off it. I hope the club show some bollocks and bin you. <CN> What audio????
<HS> No ye don’t ye fart if you did you wouldn’t celebrate like that <CN> He got pushed out of the club by a shit manager said a heartfelt goodbye and had a bottle thrown at his head for celebrating his team scoring a goal. Give it a rest fella 😂😂😂
<HS> You’re such a loser 😭😂 the kid is 19 and he had you in his pocket, so you try step up up to him like you’re at a bar in Digbeth wanting to throw hands. Smh. Just retire with grace, quietly. 🤷🏻‍♂️ <CN> A little while later Deeney and MacFadzean faced up. Deeney walked away!!!
<HS> I hate depression....x <CN> That was a tough watch. One of the most likeable guys I know, always doing so much for everyone else. Always just a message away Algie and always here if you ever need anything. Take care mate
<HS> You're a good man for this but still doesn't change the fact you're a sh.t player who should leave in the summer <CN> And you're a bell end
<HS> Remember when was a homophobic nasty vile pig and #LeighAnnePinnock said nothing. #nastyleigh <CN> u must be feeling silly rn :/
<HS> If you cheer for the rapist you’re just a bitch lol. He’s the biggest fraud I’ve ever seen. Ronaldo can’t pay his taxes, flops and cries on the pitch and then rapes during the off-season #ManUtd <CN> Mans called the all time top goal scorer a fraud 😭
<HS> U stink old man <CN> You call yourself a supporter? you're the one who stinks.

<HS> Great fake tweet spam head, you’re absolutely & firmly part of the yank Ole off the wheel and throw him under the bus gang <CN> The job is well above him, he’s timid and quiet in interviews so what’s he like in a changing room with big egos like Bruno, Pogba, Ronaldo around! Imagine Maguire trying to motivate them or give advice etc like a captain would 😫
<HS> We've just had 3 years of a dickhead bleating on about SAF as an excuse for his failure. We don't need anymore of it you microwave headed bastard. Hope this helps <CN> What's your thoughts on havertz in 10 years mike?
<HS> First of many lighters thrown at by people who don't deserve to go to football matches. This isn't a Spurs problem, it's a shitty people problem. I hope they get lifetime bans. Sort yourselves out you idiots. <CN> Ref blamed him for provoking them...

Disgusted and sickened. <CN> 🇫🇷💰Rich people buy their way out of trouble 💰🇬🇧 _____An example MUST be made_____ _________❗PLEASE SIGN❗__________ ❗😔role model allegedly drop-kicks & slaps cat in front of a child🤾🏾‍♂️❗ #westham #Zouma #Betway #RSPCA #RSPCC

<HS> absolutely all your fault again. Honestly you are the worst Spurs player of all time. Your a shit house, will not header. Will not tackle. Genuinely I'm not a keyboard warrior but you ruin every game I watch Spurs. Ffs. <CN> Ruin every game! He played a big part in our first 3 clean sheets, Chelsea’s second goal was due to the fact we gave the ball away 10 seconds before nothing he could have done!
<HS> Not dancing now are you ya massive twat <CN> Need to pay the ref and VAR to beat Chelsea 😭😭
<HS> 13 year olds shouldn't even be on twitter. They should be playing outside or gaming with the other kids. And nats not a racist you idiot <CN> So you blocked me but you are still commenting knowing I can't see it and yet you are there calling me a pussy ironic 😂😂😂😂
<HS> What a shit hole 😂🤣 <CN> Quit hating
<HS> Them twats who followed to his box when he was just trying to get away from the situation are prime examples of knobs, just leave the lad and his family alone. <CN> Literally weirdos just trying to get a reaction outta him
<HS> vile bloke, sort yourself out, wanker <CN> Have it mate
<HS> What a waste. FUCK OFF!! <CN> United should drag him out
<HS> Little prick. Just saw the video. Why get a pet to do that!? So horrible <CN> Wish I hadn’t seen the video. Utter disgrace. Says a lot about him as a person
<HS> Not a very good footballer, even worse human being <CN> Just because of a cat??? Lol
<HS> shut the fuck up you useless twat <CN> Relax bro
<HS> Absolute disgrace man. Ref needs to be punished. 🤬 <CN> Honestly it wasn't a red imo because it was a 50/50 challenge, both of them came high with their foot, Chalobah just claimed it first and unfortunately Keita couldn't stop his momentum.
<HS> I have never seen losers like and , you have the chance to go and further your career elsewhere and be relevant, you rather stick to be on the bench. Losers mentality. Fuck out of our club. <CN> Thank God realised the best thing for him and now is on the move. Wish you all the best and hopefully you have a good career ahead.

<HS> Fckkk off c#nt <CN> Most overrated midfielder
<HS> For his own good, Ole should walk away. The players, are letting the club down, not him. a World Cup winning CM who is fucking useless. A CB who cost us a fortune and can’t do shit . RB who is not close to a league winning player <CN> 3 CDM’s who wouldn’t get into my Sunday league team. Them and others in the team have let the manager and the fans down. Should be ashamed of themselves. #ManUtd #ole #ManchesterUtd #PremierLeague
<HS> That post is just so unprofessional, imagine if Everton pull their deal after watching this kinda behaviour from him. Do you think he will have any sort of career left? Absolutely disgraceful man <CN> Arsenal already rejected the deal, that's why he posted
<HS> [BODY] Fuck off you plank! <CN> [BODY] found the racist

<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> And his wife Sandra Zouma is a project manager for SEED CHARITY who works to help endangered big cats, and he is an ambassador for them too. Unreal!
<HS> cherished by the family except you you cunt. I hope your children watch the video in years to come and see what a cunt you are… <CN> watch the video on and your child is involved, already learned behaviour. Disgusting human being
<HS> You don’t deserve to play for us!!! Can’t pass can’t shoot can’t do anything!! Pathetic 🤬 <CN> Shitty Fred ..

<HS> ⁦⁩ you’re a repulsive despicable human who needs a good kicking yourself. I’d gladly volunteer to do this. This is animal cruelty & you are are repulsive in every way possible. West Ham ace Kurt Zouma filmed KICKING and slapping his pet cat <CN> I've just noticed that the cat looks like a Bengal cat - we had one, they are so gentle and sweet. I hope he's charged with animal cruelty.
<HS> snake, hope your career ends with many injuries you fraud.we’ve supported you through mistakes and your troubles. You don’t deserve to wear the badge again. <CN> Stop wishing people bad luck without knowing the truth !

<HS> fcuked up yes but you white people can kiss my ass. Your racisim is seeping out, quarter of a million because he kicked a cat. #KurtZouma <CN> Footballers are meant to be role models. This isn't about racism its about animal cruelty. A grown man who is paid millions abusing a defenless animal. He should be sacked from the club.
<HS> Scum rag lying yet again. <CN> Yup

<HS> Get locked in jail you pussy <CN> My cat is a dick and every once in a while he needs a little "push" to get him off of me, but I would never in my life try to cause harm to him. I would never be able to live with myself
<HS> don’t u dare <CN> on my knees
<HS> Kurt Zouma should never be allowed to own an animal again. Disgusting, unforgivable behaviour. <CN> I hope the cat attacks Kurt in the night while he’s asleep and slaps him around so he knows what it feels like. you disgust me.
<HS> I want to see you stick out your tongue three times against Cameroon please Riyad <CN> Riyad is a strong player and he should play with confidence in the World Cup qualifiers because he is the best in the world❤️ I hope to qualify for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 🤲
<HS> Congratulations bro, werent the first one you made your bitch <CN> So this tweet will be deleted then
<HS> Pogba snubs United, VDB wants out and Matic and Lingard too. I as a united fan want to wish the very best to them ❤️ It's all Ole's fault.

<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> Respect for this and respect to the clothesline for taking the hit too.
<HS> In my opinion, is a straight forward monster who should be prosecuted and sacked. If had been accused of this (some of his detractors might try next), then what would our MSM luvvies; our trades unions and our opposition politicians be saying/doing now? <CN> Ah, but he is of a particular colour, untouchable, probably votes Labour, so will be excused and defended sighting under privileged. This country, the world, the politicians and media who run it have gone mad.
<HS> OMG am I seeing right is playing for ? Are they for real , what a disgusting man and club to pick him after what I witnessed last , absolutely shocking , hang your heads in shame so much for internal investigation, proof is for all to see , 😡😡😡 <CN> I can’t believe they’ve played him, money over morals always 😡😡

<HS> How are the police not going to investigate this? ?? These animals are in danger! you are gutter scum. <CN> The RSPCA are investigating aren’t they? They have no legal powers though being a charity. Normally they pass evidence on to police or go through civil action. Looking like civil action in this case.
<HS> Have some shame man and retire cause you’re finished <CN> What about Mane? Should he retire after missing a sitter?
<HS> STOP SHOOTING YOU DUMBASS <CN> I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
<HS> Animal abusers like should get a taste of their own medicine, someone much bigger than him should slap and kick him... repeatedly. Then he should be dealt with my the law and banned from keeping pets. #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> Agree! If nothing else should fine and donate the money to animal charities! He should also do ‘Community Service’ at as penance!

<HS> If that’s on that recording, he can never pull a jersey on again. Disgusting. <CN> Scary thing is, he will probably get away with it. So many footballers have been abusive and somehow manage to keep themselves at the top level. It’s crazy
<HS> eeeat shit😂😂😂 <CN> I drew against the title holders, your ass drew against my sworn rivals all while you had CR7. Look at the levels
<HS> Just a shit Declan Rice <CN> Weird guy
<HS> . Fuck you <CN> That's mean
<HS> What was it that hit you when you threw yourself on the floor after no one touched you in the first half ??? Tit. <CN> It’s all out of the Slippy G playbook of theatrical cheating
<HS> The rapist shud of been put on remand , any1 else wud av been put on remand wid thos charges , one rule for the rich n famous another rule for the rest !!! #Mason_Greenwood #MUFC <CN> If they knew he’d done it, he would be on remand
<HS> Booted off flight 1st attempt flight 2 now, this is the commitment to your shitshow you pussies <CN> See you in the Crowns tomorrow, Sam.
<HS> following in the footsteps of his idol, rape-aldo vile scum 💩 <CN> Greenwood isn't Ronaldo idol..he is Pessi idol.
<HS> Messi is clear of you fraud🤡 <CN> He’s not even talking about football hes talking about his sons 🤣🤣
<HS> People out here really trying to defend Greenwood! That poor girl recording it clearly shows he's done it before and if she didn't record it, no one would have believed her! fucking scumbag! <CN> Only thing I would be cautious of is that we definitely know it’s him in the audio.
<HS> You are a disgrace. <CN> He likes a tweet that stated facts he should be awarded a medal actually
<HS> The 6 time Salon d'Or winner has a new haircut. Who cares?! Please leave our football club immediately you fucking virus #MUFC <CN> Wish he cared about making his team better than he did about this image ✊🏼I’d be embarrassed if I was him. Absolute disgrace and can’t wait til he robs a living from someone else 🤬🤬
<HS> U r literally rtarded and haven't seen a single game in ur life. U r srsly on drugs <CN> *Don't
<HS> Fuck you and take off the armband you big fat pig <CN> The fuck is wrong with you? Show some respect.
<HS> How did stay on the pitch today? Nasty little shit that should have walked. I would say a ‘hasbeen’ but never thought he was that good! are a poor team and embarrassing football club! <CN> You never though Ronaldo was that good?
<HS> DISGUSTING: Footballer has been caught on film KICKING A CAT. What kind of person attacks a cat like this? , kick him off your team to send a message that animal cruelty is never acceptable. 😡 Pls RT so the world knows what he's done. <CN> To harm an innocent animal like this for laughs shows a very disturbing personality
<HS> How does this twat get airtime , literally kills him to praise #LFC and … do you yourself a favour and fuck off will ye soft lad <CN> Been on talk shite for ages.Still talks Shite.Will always talk shite. Never get a paid job somewhere else.
<HS> Don’t come back. Disgraceful <CN> nothing to with Smith if you take the time to read the other comments
<HS> leave my club you shit cunt <CN> Is he dumb😭😭
<HS> [BODY] Piss off there then. Or is that only allowed to be said to people who voted remain, or who're foreign? <CN> [BODY] I didn't vote,Britain is fucked in or out,plus the EU is a trading block,remember that
<HS> Video of kicking and slapping his cat while another sadistic person laughs while filming. Why is this twisted and malicious person still playing for his team West Ham? <CN> How can someone be so vile
<HS> Anyone blaming Ole Gunnar Should find the highest building in the land and jump of it and when the splatter on the floor I shall piss in their brain. #ManchesterUnited blame smelly rat <CN> Yeah let’s not put any blame on the manager who picks the team. But let’s blame a player who’s not even on the pitch. Makes total sense👍
<HS> Cunt move tbf. You see this happen all the time to Ronaldo and messi and they take photos. Come across as an arsehole since day one. do your thing again this season <CN> Get out of my house
<HS> Harry fuck you you always cist us <CN> Have some respect
<HS> Have fun in the Europa league you c**nt. not even a goodbye message to the fans that supported you. Ruined the legacy of the number 21 shirt <CN> Shut up man
<HS> You stupid cunt for bringing up racism in your 100k car when another one of your kind is abusing animals. Wish you all go to hell. <CN> Your kind???? Racist.
<HS> Surrender that poor cat immediately and any other poor beings you are subjecting to abuse within your home. You are a poor excuse of a man if you pick on defenceless beings for kicks. You are paid £££'s for kicking a fucking football yet you need to hurt for laughs? <CN> You need help
<HS> [BODY] cry, you piece of shit <CN> [BODY] What a wanker 😂
<HS> Well done 👏🏿👏🏿, life time footy ban, and some jail time is needed, for the little rat once found! <CN> What’s happened lad?
<HS> Shit player <CN> Ok
<HS> You have blood on your hands g <CN> Stones kept a CS against Spurs in both PL games that season asw 😢😢 Pep will #pay
<HS> Not even sharing the video of that disgrace booting about a cat. Actually disgusting. Prick. <CN> I did just to share the comments on the video. Scary the amount of people making excuses for him or saying it's not bad.
<HS> Wake Up ! Do you think that we are your time! If you don't want to play anymore, say it, and leave. Otherwise, stay focus and play your game! You're absolutely shit for 2 years now! Wake Up! <CN> That pass is sabotage #MUFC
<HS> spit in my mouth <CN> ayo who hacked me 😭?
<HS> absolutely embarrassing ! <CN> Because when you’re in agony you can do a series of “caterpillar” roly polys across the pitch 😂😂😂
<HS> Yo man YOU SUCK <CN> Hope they see this bro 🙏
<HS> It’s an absolute disgrace but sort of sums up the new era of football. All about money and they’ll use something like ‘we need to stand by our man, it’s up to the authorities to do their job, not us’. Shame on shame on shame on You’re all scum <CN> It says a lot about him as a person - and in front of his children, he should be prosecuted and sacked, Moyes was spineless as well!
<HS> Then put a shift in and act like you fucking care, you shit house. <CN> He made one mistake, what about Harry Hero Maguire who makes mistake after mistake then drones on to fans about doing better
<HS> I would kill my entire family for you <CN> Chloe at the next family gathering contemplating risking it all.
<HS> I really hope I never see in an #mufc shirt again. Fucking tiny human being <CN> Hopefully in any football shirt
<HS> As an honest chelshit fan, I must admit that its so stupid for Tuchel to instruct players to assume the role of a goal keeper. FIFA needs to assess the credibility of managers before employment. I'm disgusted, dismayed, disbanded and drastically downmowed. Bye. Off to Manchester <CN> It’s obvious you got scar in your 🧠
<HS> so, so sorry for the abuse that you and others had to suffer . Clearly has F for Failed. U for useless. Respect? What on Earth are they doing opening the gates to people with such hate. <CN> I did not abuse anyone, thanks
<HS> Fuck yourself you bald cunt <CN> Wtf
<HS> A sublime finish from for at but rather than giving Raz due credit the emphasis is all placed on poor defending - pathetic, but predictable commentary. You’d think Andy Hinchcliffe was a 5x Ballon d’Or winner - he’s a snide shite🤬 <CN> Very cynical indeed. It just bleeds the broadcast of entertainment and energy. So much about Norwich today? Maybe the booth was lost in FA Cup sentiment, where the underdog has to be talked up ad nauseam. Just not sure that's the best way to showcase the defending PL champ.
<HS> Aubameyang is a disgrace of a footballer. Shit captain 🤝 Shit performances this season. Sweg Sweg🤡 <CN> W
<HS> DECLARE FOR CANADA YOU SNAKE <CN> Ahahaha didn’t know you were Canadian, now I like you even more
<HS> I’d fight or Two weak fucks doing atrocious shit can get their heads cracked open. <CN> You’re hard
<HS> The fucking state of that. Fuck you <CN> Fuck me that’s brutal
<HS> fuck you <CN> where’s lube them cheeks at pal?
<HS> #Catslivesmatter you evil man. You are a coward by abusing a defenceless animal is totality inexcusable and for the twat that filmed it I have no words. I expect you to at least give a month’s salary to an animal charity and I hope the take action. <CN> The cat needs to be rescued today! Everyone involved needs to be banned from owning animals for life. He also needs to be sacked & prosecuted for animal cruelty.
<HS> Dearest Save us all the hassle and headache, just fuck of back to Juve you shithouse and end this constant saga of shit talk in the media every international break when you drop hints, you absolute fucking prick. Cheers x <CN> Literally just said the same to one of the lads. How hard is it to say fuck all. Ya just know he’ll sign a new deal on massive money too, the prick.
<HS> Dumb ignorant and heartless. "I don't condone....but..." There are no 'but's', ever, when a cat gets kicked like a football. Why deflect the subject to a race issue? What a 💩 response. <CN> WTAF!! When did racism became an issue associated with animal cruelty 😡
<HS> Core of British players Let me guess. Scott Mctominay You lot are as much a disgrace as Ole Solskjaer. Losers with zero character #OleOut <CN> Greenwood
<HS> Today’s news from the and are having a secret relationship. Not anymore you nosey annoying parasite bastards. Plus who gives a rats arse what they are doing. Papers are so vile <CN> I didn't know about that until I saw your post tbf lol
<HS> Hardcore Everton fan? Fuck off ya beaut <CN> cry old man
<HS> Working to get 𝘽𝘼𝘾𝙆 😤😤 <CN> I don’t think he out for 10 week
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> Have a day off. You should be able to celebrate however you want, winding up fans is fine without having a bottle thrown at you.
<HS> How are the police not going to investigate this? ?? These animals are in danger! you are gutter scum. <CN> I bet they would have done something if it had been a dog 😡. I hope at least all pets are removed and he is banned from ever owning one again.
<HS> Maybe that’s your expertise you fraud!! <CN> Are you high?
<HS> A few people defending ?? How can someone defend a player who refuses to be part of the squad. Tony, you’re a disgrace you’re paid a ton of cash and you think you are more important than the club? Just go, go now. #MUFC <CN> Did you not hear the news? Ralf is a racist
<HS> Newsflash , it seems to bother you that City haven’t won a Champions League more than it does City fans themselves, By the way, you’ve only won one league title, despite apparently having the best player in every position, Question yourself first, classless prick <CN> Oi try above tweet for your 🎣 And Simon, for 'chequebook manager' try elite coach 💙
<HS> Absoloute disgrace as a muslim <CN> Why? He doesn’t live in a Muslim country. This country celebrates Christmas
<HS> Rot in hell you fucking scumbag <CN> I no from the very first time that you don't like the guy so just say whatever rubbish you like but am telling you greenwood is gonna win that case
<HS> Get out of this club you snakey rat, awful footballer <CN> Never change man😂
<HS> Bruno Fernandes says Maguire is shhit 😂 <CN> The truth dey hurt pass
<HS> Na you fvck up..you would have stayed back at West Ham <CN> Fuck you !!!
<HS> Leeds fans- "Tyrone mings is fucking shit" *Aston villa wins 3-0* - <CN> 😂😂 Really did have the last laugh
<HS> As a volunteer with cats, I want to say , you are a cunt. You’re not sorry. You weren’t sorry before the leak were you? You’re a human piece of garbage who has no business in the sport. Fuck you. Fuck your career. You don’t deserve it. <CN> And bad show for playing him tonight. Hope this backfires on you.
<HS> “I want to rinse the club of every penny i can get because i’m a scumbag” <CN> Naa not really who wouldn’t keep there job if it’s good money
<HS> You’re disgusting <CN> Hazard right foot Is bigger than your whole club
<HS> Ur shit pal <CN> And you call yourself a supporter get WHU out of your @ if you can’t back or support any of our players 💯
<HS> I'll pay for your hair transplant myself if you just fuck off now 👍🏻 <CN> Think he’s affording that quite comfortably thanks to are board
<HS> I passionately hate 👿 <CN> Lol . I would hate him if he was at my club but I love him at man united 😂
<HS> [BODY] 😒😒 <CN> [BODY] He was shit, Rudiger is better
<HS> should never be given chance to play for us again. He plays like he has arrived but he's crap...very shitty player😤 <CN> Why d hate man? Be a little be constructive in your criticism
<HS> NFTs are a load of 💩💩💩 <CN> Just say you can’t afford one 🙄🙄
<HS> hey big head <CN> please leave my boyfriend alone
<HS> That’s how you treat a 🐈 you vile individual 🤬 <CN> You can see it in her eyes she saying “Less talky talky, more pety pety you tin opener”
<HS> Shut up man <CN> Instead of doing warm weather training you wanna party with the Godfather AND then apologise the next day? 🤡
<HS> Yet again was absolutely Shit, why is he wearing a UTD shirt? He’s not the only one that shouldn’t be!!!! <CN> But but but he got an assist? 😂
<HS> What a way to ruin your career, you absolute scumbag <CN> Whats he done?
<HS> This overpaid & pampered cat abuser should not be on the pitch tonight or anytime soon. No excuse for animal abuse #KurtZouma <CN> Why is he still allowed to play? And why have not said or done anything? [BODY]
<HS> How’s saying that going to make him innocent #masongreenwood #scum #prison #badman <CN> At this time aswell man full blast
<HS> He's not my starboy HE'S NOT MY STARBOY FUCKYOU <CN> Phil would never
<HS> BRUUUUCE LEEEE SHIIIITT #NUFC <CN> Looked more Van Damme but who gives 😁
<HS> We’re getting ucl before u hold datt😹😹👎👎 <CN> Wtf is this Bro? Be happy for Auba
<HS> Never thought would say this but you are a evil wan*er <CN> What a absolute wanker I’ve just seen it fucking shocking
<HS> Front page headline tomorrow in the … turns out the ill spoken Wally who told the hero to “focus on the day job!” …. Has a second job lol. What a numpty <CN> Would I be correct if I were to guess that second job doesn’t involve looking after poor & vulnerable children?
<HS> You are an absolute prick <CN> If he does that to a cat what does he do to those around him?
<HS> Absolutely sickening should be absolutely ashamed of himself and should banish him from the team. No place for animal cruelty. Imagine being so hard you kick lumps out of your cat! Disgusting to see. #Zouma #WestHam #KurtZouma <CN> What a disgusting human being! What example do you show your children!
<HS> You fucking bum, if you have any respect you’ll request a transfer next summer and fuck off <CN> State of you
<HS> Kill joy? No your a sick fuck for having a picture of a man that's dead and saying it's family in Afghanistan who's been injured? There's joking then there's sick <CN> My bad ♥️
<HS> . you fucken animal❤️ <CN> That was gorgeous
<HS> you’re so bad, i knew you were sh1t but my word <CN> I didn't even see the match but reading the chances he had and missed 🤦🏼‍♀️ Arsenal need to sign a CF badly. And get Arthur deal done and dusted.
<HS> He’s shite pal <CN> Nah cmon man not now…
<HS> Why the fuck did sign 😡😡😡😡 <CN> You have Maguire as your Captain but its Sancho that's stressing you?
<HS> Fuck off u are embarrassing #avfc #trezeguet <CN> What I really dont get why didn’t he fizz it across the box, could have at least done that before the embarrassing dive
<HS> Nice of to turn up for arsenal, shame he couldn’t for England, CUNT <CN> Getting piped
<HS> 7PM and we out here assisting on CL nights, what are you doing ? sleeping like a d|ckhead, D|CKHEAD . <CN> dont beg it we remember the slander
<HS> Look. Let's put it this way. Fuck Jesse Lingard. You could've left for a pay cut or for a lower signing on fee and you didn't fancy it pal. Now you're crying cos big ol bad United won't give you away. Take a pay cut or shut the fuck up <CN> Nah we done him dirty…Utd can’t run a bath
<HS> Its so sad to see throwing his career away before it has barely begun What an idiot, keep it in your pants man! <CN> Keep it in your pants. ? He clearly has no self control and certainly no respect for women. Disgraceful .
<HS> Hey do Chelsea play the winner of this game #SupperBowl #SuperbowlLVI for the universe club championship? to score the winner ya miserable gap toothed git. <CN> Nah. We've already won it. World club champions. Nothing changes that
<HS> That’s been one of the most distressing stories I’ve ever heard about. Strangely it’s pics of him trying to join the family hug, for him to be cold shouldered by her & her eating Maccies in front of him when he’s starving. Vermin, & I expect flack, but they should rot. <CN> I know it’s vile so sad really is
<HS> Your shit mate <CN> Cry g
<HS> I love my cat. Fuck you <CN> I’m not a cat man but that’s sick what he done
<HS> I’ll one on one you cunt. <CN> If it gets on tops I’ll jump in
<HS> one of them annoying cunts who put a capital at the start of every word <CN> One of them ann0ying cvnts who lack joy and peace in their lives being so bothered about how a person chooses to use their internet space
<HS> Someone needs to throw a pig’s head on the pitch at the Etihad i’m livid, he’s ruined all the memories the cunt. You better two foot him captain <CN> It could be another Fabregas situation fella, where United have been offered the deal and haven’t taken it so he’s got no choice to take the other attractive offer to get back in the prem?
<HS> Congrats on 100 pl goals… Shame ur still shit <CN> thoughts
<HS> Another addition to prison FC <CN> That already better than Leeds
<HS> YOURE SH!T <CN> overdoing it now
<HS> You're embarrassing <CN> Look at u
<HS> Just to be clear - booting and slapping a defenceless animal around the kitchen is WAY WORSE THAN RACISM. Why is this always the defence? Idiot. <CN> Countless defenceless cows,goats and chickens are killed everyday.
<HS> Manutd fans yesterday calling him a snake 😂 <CN> I didn't see any...stop spreading bs
<HS> is the fucking goat don’t dare absolutely ridiculous <CN> He scores goals it’s that simple
<HS> Think it’s poor some fans startin to turn on mind, been a rare speckle of glitter in an absolute pile of dog shit. Could drop Messi in this squad and he’d still look average at times. Clubs on its arse from 14 years of Ashley nowt else, don’t forget that. #NUFC <CN> Think it's the fact he didn't look arsed, aye he had 3 men on him as soon as he got the ball he needed support but he just looked like he couldn't be bothered mate, I'm a maxi fan, the player and the person but not one of them on that pitch showed any heart, not one. Unforgivable
<HS> Whoever hacked my account and slagged Ronaldo off I’m gonna fuck you up <CN> Kindly send a DM to for locked, suspended, banned, hacked and disabled account they are expert in recovering account.
<HS> Don’t take your chances = get punished. Player not good enough starting constantly and embarrassing this club. Get the fuck out you’re useless <CN> but but d1 hes going to kill it at LW!!!
<HS> Worst captain ever and on top of it coached by worst Manchester United coach. is an absolute waste of money and a liability <CN> Why do u have to take it too far. Weird sad don.
<HS> you are a FUCKING DISGRACE. . your bitch should be fucking ASHAMED being associated with you. SO SHOULD YOUR CHILD. fuck me. WORST FOOTBALLER of the 21ST CENTURY. LEAVE YOU CVN****** <CN> i genuinely hate you
<HS> is a sick man who needs to spend time inside a cell for animal abuse. Disgusting excuse for a human 😡😡 <CN> I hope will do the right thing and sack him.
<HS> keep twerking for chelshit <CN> warra 3rd league goal in february for the goat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
<HS> Shut up you bellend <CN> Cry
<HS> Disgraceful yes. But perhaps think twice about bating the home crowd when your team scores, eh ? Dick. <CN> There should be more players celebrating in front of opposition fans. It’s great seeing players winding up fans, more of it please
<HS> #westhamunited ANYONE touches a cat again from your team and I will personally fly across the ocean and break every one of your goddamn legs so NO[BODY] will play football ever again. Serious - ANY CAT KICKER'S LEGS WILL BE BROKEN. <CN> For the life of me I can't understand the mindset that compels people to inflict pain on any of our animal friends. I don't even squash bugs/spiders if they 'invade' my home.
<HS> The captain of your nations team asks you for a pen and you have seen him taking it for years and almost every time scoring it but still you decide to take it yourself just to have what? Spolight? Applauds? That is the dumbest move you dimwit . <CN> All this would've been avoided if he'd just scored uno!
<HS> Fuck u <CN> Fuck u again
<HS> Just saying if you call yourself a Norwich fan and then go onto racially abuse our players you most definitely aren’t a Norwich fan. Absolutely disgusting. All with you . #ncfc <CN> These lot make fake accounts just to do this, probably does support Norwich but clearly not a real fan.
<HS> Another day, another vile cunt, fuck you <CN> It’s the fact that these bastards video it. Wicked fuckers.
<HS> Laugh it up #CFC, #sugardaddy prem-era club whose vocal support was an embarrassment tonight. Dross should also find a soul in his locker just for being... well, dross. #UTV #vtid money can't buy you love. <CN> C'mon Goatsy, you remember Bumstead, Spackman, Dixon, Speedie, Bates' electric fences and that 3 wheeled blue disabled car parked on the outer perimeter of The Bridge pitch??
<HS> OMG f_ck off from my club <CN> OMG f*ck off from the comment section get a life bruh
<HS> Fuck off you fucking cunt <CN> You’re a complete loser. Go support someone else.
<HS> We don’t deserve u Harry <CN> Why it's not like he played any better.
<HS> Mikel Arteta is such a vindictive twat who should never have managed Arsenal Football Club. What a horrible human being. I stand with . <CN> This was a blunder by the gaffer. Whatever the case, he shouldn't have stated the reasons for dropping the player. Auba carried Arsenal when Arsenal was down. He should be carried when he is down. The man was late because he went to visit his sick mum. Arteta goofed here!
<HS> Only a piece of shit would do what you’ve just done Who do you represent you coward? You get on your knees Bengal Cats Lives Matter I see your middle name is Happy Are you happy with your behaviour Kurt lad? <CN> Sack him, then deport the tw
<HS> Just a shit Declan Rice <CN> That’s actually quite funny. Even other players know our owners are a laughing stock 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
<HS> look at this twat doing PR again because his performances have been shambolic. The PR is to save him and prolong his career by milking it at the club <CN> You the biggest prick in our fan base, shows what a person you are. Literally just acknowledging a kid doing good work, more to life than football.
<HS> Who is this woman who has opened the door to discrimination, division + segregated across Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 She is a disgrace #LetGarethDaviesVote #WelshApartheid <CN> She should be sacked. And the vote annulled. Anybody whom suffers harm, loss or anguish because of this decision should sue her, the Govt and the pharma funded freaks behind all of this sh1tsh0w. #Rigged
<HS> Seeing loads of news articles mentioning "assault & domestic violence". Not one mentioning sexual assault or rape because by the sound of this video that's exactly what he is, a rapist! <CN> Ok, if this is what it sounds like, then something needs to be done both at a legal and at the club level. Need validated source though.
<HS> Get out my clurb <CN> You in the wrong "clurb" pal
<HS> Don't come back again <CN> Lol waiting do ham That's one of your best play at the moment 😅😅😅
<HS> King Sh*t <CN> Am sure your account was hacked? I had so much respect for you to say this
<HS> That silly bint who claims was racially abused has blocked me.🤣🤣🤣🤣 fucking idiot. <CN> She’s a racist dickhead, and I blocked her, and a load of her overseas sycophants, who probably think cats should be in a stir fry……
<HS> Stf***u <CN> It's mad cosidering how scary successful you were for all those years under AF, to think how shit Man Utd are now, both on the pitch & how the club operates. It's just so strange to see right? It must feel so strange for you especially. It's so wild how times change isn't it?
<HS> Munch says f*ck you <CN> We are slowly starting a cat army
<HS> Tell us it was Maguire and give us a chance to kick that incompetent fuck out of the club <CN> Probably more but yeah fair play to that...
<HS> HEY! you little bitch, dont u ever kick tsimikas again. Twat. #YNWA #LFC #CHELIV <CN> he was hanging onto his leg. only regret is he didn’t kick him harder 😩😩 tsimikas not scaring anyone
<HS> they ain’t shit fr <CN> nah jadon is SEXY 🤚🏽 note the difference
<HS> get out my club you stupid fucking idiot <CN> He couldn't defend even if his life depended on it
<HS> By the way Mr Hercules El Matador EdinsonCavani , kindly fuck off and never come back 🙏🏾 <CN> Man's stealing £250k doing nothing..
<HS> LEAVE MAN WTF ARE YOU DOING, RUBEN FUCKING LOFTUS CHEEK IS GETTING LEFT WING MINUTES BEFORE OR YOU <CN> He needs to leave in January, this is getting out of hand now
<HS> Come get yo position back nigga <CN> you reek
<HS> So you cowardly shithouse - have seen enough in the video shot by your gobshite brother to seize your “cherished” cats from you! Hope you’re prosecuted too. really shit decision to play him last night Moyes is a disgrace #KurtZoumaAnimalAbuser <CN> He won't be bothered about it at all...it's just good for the animals being taken away...he'll just go and get some nasty dog or summat that suits his personality...horrible bastard.
<HS> If Mason Greenwood had done that to my daughter you would be seeing his picture everywhere you looked with the word MISSING next to it because I’d move heaven and earth to get revenge. Horrible little scumbag. <CN> Something screams money here! Surely her father is getting pressured into making that statement? 💰
<HS> He is just an idiot Arab😂 <CN> Your name in Arabic Amir 😂😂
<HS> To people who asks why i hate Chiellini <CN> Tactical foul, fuck all wrong w it
<HS> . is a finished cunt in my book. <CN> i guess ronaldo was helping the youth out…

<HS> You silly c*nt! <CN> ZOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<HS> Leave the club you fucking fool, go develop elsewhere this club doesn’t appreciate you <CN> What’s there to appreciate ? He’s not a good footballer
<HS> Got to love fans turning on a 20 year old lad and blaming your sh*t season on him. #Pathetic would struggle in your Team you Morons. Call him back as this will do more harm than good mentally to 💙 #CFC <CN> I keep seeing Norwich fans compare Gilmour to Skipp. Not sure why when Skipp is a defensive midfielder and Gilmour is a playmaker
<HS> Little prick. Just saw the video. Why get a pet to do that!? So horrible <CN> Should go to jail, poor little animals can't even defend themselves
<HS> Fuck off <CN> Unnecessary really, he is being sold
<HS> Your shite <CN> Nob head
<HS> i am genuinely so happy to see that this absolute scum has been arrested and the police have done it all so fast, hopefully gives people in the same situation the courage to speak out and get something done about the situation p.s hope u rot in there ya prick:) <CN> 100% absolute scumbag man, that video of the voice note is horrible
<HS> N0nce <CN> Move this ratio and that's cool. But I'm also sad because my trust wallet has been hacked I try validate my account during error my raca coin has send to other wallet please help to solve this problem
<HS> Play us now you prick <CN> ??🤣🤣
<HS> You animal . <CN> Totally agree mate. From what I heard he raped that poor girl. It must’ve been going on for a while for her to record it. Hope Mendy has a double cell.
<HS> Leave my club trashford <CN> bro its christmas
<HS> Another young PL player who thinks he can do anything he wants. I hope you’re never EVER near the England squad ever again. Do not care you’re one of the best upcoming strikers, you’re a fucking little cretin and no role model to kids anywhere. <CN> He should be sacked and locked up. That's rape and no other way of dressing it up. I've seen people on twitter saying there's 2 sides to every story. People need to give their heads a wobble 🤬
<HS> Fuck off <CN> CRYYYYYYYYY MORE
<HS> Leave my club asap 😡 <CN> It's more his club than yours

<HS> Look how has thrown his potential great career away. All over pussy😶😶😶😶😶😶 <CN> Sad isn’t it
<HS> Scumbag cheater loser <CN> Absolutely 0 cheating involved. You guys didn't kick the ball out of play so Lazio had every right to keep playing.
<HS> Shame on you Mason You are a disgrace to Manchester United and what we stand for. I hope you never play for Manchester United again and be tried and convicted for your crimes <CN> Who play well than Greenwood in Manchester team fuck
