Legend v Loser. You’re not winning this battle you absolute fraud <response> This has happened in Utds dressing room. Calls the team shit, sits down & directs it to the door that Pirlo & coaches are entering. Crybabies don’t like criticism. Imagine Ronaldo looking at Maguire as the captain thinking “they paid the same price for him that they sold me for” <END>  
<input> If Ole turns into a RWB I will personally fly over there and escort Jadon back to Dortmund myself. <response> No need to, going Germany next week anyways, might have to make a detour to Manchester before going to my hometown near Dortmund <END>

<input> Get out your ass we know your best friends but we don’t want that cockroach anywhere near our club <response> The pundits think by signing a Striker we'll be fine. We need a bloody midfielder. Pogba can't play in midfield cause we don't have a player that can run a game on his own. He has to accommodate on the Left Wing. <END>  
<input> wtf is this for a title. Taking the fucking piss <response> I feel bad for you lot. Can’t imagine De gea doing this. I’d be fuming. I know its harmless, but feels disrespectful to the club’s fans. Its entertaining to rival fans but I completely understand why you’d be pissed. <END>

Maybe role models like him are the reason this world is so messed up! you are a disgusting person & should be ashamed of yourself! <response> There is a name for people who abuse innocent creatures. <END>  
<input> Piss off. It is not Oleout! The defence has been diabolical. 3 goals conceded because of #OleOutNow <response> Maguire was shit but you can't deny the fact that ole and his coaching team can't get the best out of the team. Subs at wrong times, leaving players on who aren't performing. These are all of the decisions he had to make and from what I've seen, he isn't doing it <END>
