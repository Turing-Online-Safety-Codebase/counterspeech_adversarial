"Other than draft lottery, what ideas do you have to prevent/reduce tanking? For me, I think one of the ways is to use the luxury tax money, and instead of giving those to teams under the luxury line, you give those money to lottery teams. And teams with a better record but fails to get in the playoff will get the most money. This will also encourage more teams to go over the luxury line, since right now a lot of teams are reluctant to go over the line because those luxury tax money are currently spit among teams under the line.

I'm in love with a coworker I'm not gay or anything like that. I've known this guy for 6 months and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm so lonely. I can't get him out of my head. I've never felt so lonely before. You should have written that you're in love with a coworker. I'm not sure if the title is a bit misleading.

"What to do with my old Sonos ? Hi,  I've deactivate my old Sonos Gen 1 to get the 30% to buy a new one. What should I do with my old Sonos ? Send it back to Sonos ? Put it in a recycling bin ?    Regards. Sell it, keep it, do whatever you want with it.  People complained and got rid of the actual recycling portion of it, so you could even throw it in a landfill if you wanted. (in a challenge way)","&gt; throw it in a landfill if you wanted  Sure, or just toss it into the closest river because who fucking cares anyway. /s  Even if it can't be repurposed, it can still be recycled properly.",disagrees_with_the_post,sonos,covert,challenge,,,,elf22
"Wear the Mask!!! If your comming into panda, wear the mask, if you have a medical condition (a serious one) listen to your options. If there’s a drive thru go through it. If the store tells you something DO IT. We have the right to refuse service if you don’t want to follow instructions. Believe me we want this to end but until the government stops threading to close business that ignore their mask rules you gota follow them and don’t get pissy. Like this will will help lol.

How good is a 1445 2v rating? I just went down to today from 1564.This is my first expansion doing arenas so I honestly don’t feel it’s that bad considering it only took me a month to get to 1450ish.How good is this rating and how long will it take me to get to 1800.Also should I be worrying about my rating right now or should I just keep practicing and learning and the rating will go up. After you have played for a while you will realize that everything under 2k counts as 0 (in an expose way),"The fuck does that even mean?  Counts as 0 rating to who? There's quite a gap between Combatant and Rival alone, skill doesn't just suddenly start mattering once you hit 2k",disagrees_with_the_post,worldofpvp,covert,expose,,,,elf22
Reddit : Conspiracy.. one of the only subs where you’ll see a phenomenal post with no likes and endless comments. Censorship is a pain in the ass. Reddit doesn’t have ‘likes’ maybe you would prefer to spend your time on Facebook? (in an engage way),Yeah sounds like OP wants a system with only upvotes and no downvotes which is in itself a form of censorship,disagrees_with_the_post,conspiracy,covert,engage,,,,elf22
"Can Fanduel cancel a bet I won after it had paid out? I made a bet on the Lightning vs. Stars hockey game last night. At the middle of the 3rd period, I took the over and the bet won. Fanduel paid it out initially and then I wake up this morning and they canceled the bet and took my winnings back. Are they allowed to do that or is it even legal? It sounds like an error. How did you bet the over after the game started? That in-and-of itself is an error and you know it. (in an engage way)",They move the line? I mean I'm fairly new to sports betting and I am only familiar with Fanduel's sportsbook but you can bet on the over mid game in any game basically. So if it was an error then no I didn't know it.,disagrees_with_the_post,sportsbetting,covert,engage,,,,elf22
"Vip Tours Anybody here been on these tours, that can talk about them? Also anyone know how much the private vip one costs?

"Snow: Shovel once in the morn, or a few times before then I’ve been in CT for the last three Winters. This is the first time a storm’s come through that’s supposed to last this far into the next workday. I was lucky the last few times—they happened on my days off. I’m a critical worker.   My question: is it better to wait until morning to brush and shovel? Or should I plan on making multiple takes throughout the night?  I’m in a new neighborhood this year and street (no restrictions road) parked. No access to a blower. If you have a driveway, park at the end of it - not in the road. You will have a much smaller area of snowplow mound to deal with to get going. (in an engage way)",Park at the end near the road or closest to the house?

"Had the All-Star Game not been cancelled this year, the Dodgers would have become just the fourth team EVER to both win the World Series and host the All-Star Game in the same season. Seven teams have come close, hosting the All-Star Game and losing the World Series in the same season, but the only three teams that have both hosted *and* won are the 1939 Yankees, 1959 Dodgers, and 1977 Yankees. As someone from the future, you can add the 2021 Braves on the list as well (in an engage way)","Dang recommend me what to bet on, this year's coming along pretty badly",disagrees_with_the_post,baseball,covert,engage,,,,elf22
